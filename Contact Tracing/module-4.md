# Module 4
## Video: Contact Tracing as a Common Public Health Tool

EMILY GURLEY: Hello. My name is Emily Gurley. And I'm an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Now I'm going to talk to you about the ethics of contact tracing and some technological tools that are used for contact tracing. After going through this lecture, you should be able to define and provide examples of important terms, like privacy, autonomy, and public good. You should be able to describe the balance between protecting public health and the limits to privacy and autonomy of individuals. You should be able to provide examples of the balance between keeping information private and protecting public health. You should also be able to identify a selection of technological tools that have been developed or are being used for each step of case investigations and contact tracing. 

> *Contact tracing is a very common public health tool.*

It's important for stopping the spread of COVID-19. But it's used every day by public health to protect the health of the public. Contact tracing protects the health of people, because if we can limit contact between infectious people and others, we can limit opportunities for SARS-CoV-2 to be transmitted. So it's really important to keep in mind here that the whole case investigation and contact tracing effort is being done to protect the health of the public. Contact tracing is used every day to stop disease transmission. It's used for tuberculosis, syphilis, which is a sexually transmitted disease, HIV, and you may recall a large outbreak of Ebola in West Africa. Contact tracing was a key part of the strategy to end that outbreak. You can see here that contact tracing in that scenario was done even by boat. Much of the contact tracing was done in person. So there are many different ways that contact tracing is done. But it's important to remember this is a common tool. It's used every day. And it's going to be used also to help stop the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Video: Defining Privacy, Confidentiality, and other terms about Ethics
SPEAKER: As a contact tracer, you're going to learn private information, confidential information about people. 

> *So it's important to understand and define what does privacy mean, what does confidentiality mean, and define some other terms about the ethics of contact tracing that you'll need to understand.* 

First, let's talk about privacy. So these are all legal concepts. So I'm going to give you the legal definition, and also, explain what it means practically. So the legal definition of privacy is the right of a person to be free from intrusion or publicity concerning their personal matters. So what does that mean? Basically, it means that everyone has the right to keep their personal life personal. But as a contact tracer you're going to come into contact with people's private information, because you need to to do your job and to protect the health of the public. So you're going to be asking them private information, like who lives in a house with you, who did you spend time with in the past, where have you gone in the past week, how much time did you spend with people in your home and outside your home? Those are examples of personal or private information, but you're going to need to know them. 

> *So it's important to remember that a contact tracer can ask about private information, but only for the purposes of contact tracing.*

And a contact tracer can use the private information that people provide, but only for contact tracing purposes. So the general summary is, you can ask about, learn, and use private information, information from people's private lives, but only for protecting the public, only for contact tracing purposes.
Now, let's talk about confidentiality. Sometimes people use privacy and confidentiality together, but they're slightly different. So the legal definition of confidentiality is the right of an individual to have personal, identifiable, medical information kept private, and not to be released without his, or her, or their consent. So what does that mean? It means your medical information can't be shared with anyone else unless you agree to it, typically. But if it's being shared to protect public health, then it can be shared. In particular, the results from a COVID-19 test can be shared with others for the purposes of contact tracing to protect public health. So there are limits around what can be shared and with whom. So examples of confidential information that you'll be discussing during case investigations and contact tracing includes, any other medical conditions that the case or contact may have, because, remember, that could put them at high risk for severe disease. You'll also, of course, be discussing results from their COVID-19 test. So a contact tracing can only learn about medical information that's relevant to the contact tracing that you're doing, and can only be used for contact tracing purposes. So similar to private information about people, contact tracers are also going to learn about confidential medical information of cases and contacts. And they can learn about it, and they can use it, but only for contact tracing purposes. Next, let's talk about autonomy. Autonomy legally means the right of a person to make their own decisions. It's also known as the right to self or an agency. And what this really means, is that each person can make their own decisions. This is true unless the decisions they make or the things they do can harm someone else. And we all know that this is true. And in the case of contact tracing, it means that people can make their own decisions. But if they're not isolating themselves or not quarantining themselves, that could harm someone else. It does put other people at risk, so they do have some limits on their autonomy, or their ability to make their own decisions within the context of contact tracing. So where does autonomy show up in contact tracing? Where will you encounter it? Well, you're requesting someone to quarantine, and you're requesting cases to isolate themselves from others, so you will try to convince them of this. But in some circumstances, these may be mandated or enforced, and that's because it's not entirely up to the person to make their own decisions about what they do if what they do can harm others. So here's a place where we have to balance, again, individual rights and protecting the health of the public. Next, I want to talk about the concept of justice. So we've talked about how contact tracing can include private confidential information about people, and it can also limit their autonomy. But it's for protection of the public health. And we can accept these things as long as what we're doing to protect public health is just. Let's talk a little bit about what justice means in the context of contact tracing. So the legal definition of justice is to act or to treat an individual justly or fairly, meaning that everyone should be treated the same way, independent of their race, ethnicity, creed, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, or gender. Essentially, this means that everyone must receive the same treatment regardless of who they are. So some examples of justice and contact tracing mean that, contact tracers will attempt to find all cases and contacts regardless of religion, race, or sexual orientation. 
> *And this is because finding the cases and finding contacts is an important public health service.*

And cases and contacts benefit from this, so every one should be just. Everyone should get this service. In addition, all communities, regardless of wealth, for example, should have contact tracing efforts to reduce transmission. So this means that contact tracing should be done in all communities at risk. We can't just select some communities to do this and some communities not. To be just, it has to be applied, it has to be used to protect all communities and all populations. Now, let's define one more term before we move on, and that's public good. So the legal definition of a public good is anything that benefits or provides for the well-being of the public. Essentially, it means something that benefits everyone in the society. Contact tracing programs are an example of a public good, because they can reduce the risk to the public of being infected from SARS-coronavirus-2. They can reduce illness and deaths from COVID-19. So when we talk about contact tracing programs, we're talking about a public good. [MUSIC PLAYING]

## Video: Balancing Public Good with Privacy, Autonomy, and Confidentiality
SPEAKER: So case investigations and contact tracing provide a public good. But we always have to balance this with respect for privacy, autonomy, and confidentiality. So let's talk a little bit more about what that balance means, and how it's practiced. Contact tracing programs are a public good, because they're going to reduce the risk for the public from COVID-19. And we must balance this good for society with the rights of people, their private information, confidential information, and their autonomy. So we always have to be sure that we're getting this balance right. Legally, there are often three tests that are used to determine whether a public health intervention is balanced in terms of the public good and individual rights. So in order for the public health intervention to be able to limit the rights of individuals to privacy or autonomy, as contact tracing can sometimes do, it must meet three tests or criteria. And these are, that it must be respectful of individuals and their rights, it must be a benefit to society, that is balanced with the limits on individuals, and three, that intervention must benefit all members of society. So we can see with contact tracing that it does meet all three of these legal tests, because contact tracers are respectful of individuals and their rights. Indeed, they're reaching out to them to provide them with services, make sure they're getting medical care, and make sure that they're doing everything they can to help prevent spread in their communities. It meets the test number two, because it's a benefit to society, and it's balancing the need for information and the limits on individuals with the public health good in mind. Also this intervention will benefit all members of society, because contact tracing will be done anywhere where there's a case identified. So it will meet all three tests. 

![2020-06-11_00-46-41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45191356/84820797-00848f80-afcf-11ea-8ec2-ad0c4f780777.png)
 
Just as a side note, there is a legal basis for contact tracing in the United States, because there is an authority to conduct public health interventions and individual state constitutions, and the US Constitution. There are clauses that say that states and the US government can act to protect the public welfare. And there are other common law and general principles that apply here as well. You may know that there are other situations where public health interventions are used to protect welfare, and they do place some limits on the rights of individuals. So, for example, we often require children to receive vaccinations to attend to public school, and that's to protect the community's public health and safety. So it's another example of where we're balancing the rights of individuals with public health for the public good. Another example comes from a different disease where we also do contact tracing. So, for example, if you have tuberculosis, which is another infectious disease, it can be highly contagious. So if you have tuberculosis and you refuse to take your medication, which cures you and means you're not infectious anymore, so if you are refusing to take that medication, you could be required to do so by the health department. And, again, that's so you don't infect other people. So they're placing some limits on your autonomy here, or your ability to make your own decisions, because your decisions have a direct impact on other people in society. So health departments will take action to protect health of others. There's a legal basis for this, and we already do it in many other health situations for the public good. Although contact tracers and the contact tracing effort does intrude on people's lives, it should be done only with the utmost respect. And cases and contacts should understand this. So we can assure cases and contacts that the information that they provide will be confidential, so it will only be used for the public health investigation for the purposes of contact tracing, and it's not going to be shared with anyone else who doesn't need to know for the purposes of contact tracing. So this means that the information, again, will only be shared with the people who have to know it for the purposes of contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine. You should also assure cases and contacts that the information will be kept private. So contacts who are identified will be told that they've been exposed to someone who's infectious, but they will not be told who the case is, so you can reassure the case that if they share who their contacts are, you're not going to disclose their name to those contacts. So let's go through an example of when a case might tell you private information and what you should do. Let's say, for example, during an interview with a COVID-19 case, he tells you that his contacts are his wife, his two children, and also his girlfriend who lives in the neighborhood. So two questions for you, should you list his girlfriend as a contact, and should you tell his wife about his girlfriend? So the answer to the first question is, yes. Of course, she's been exposed, and she should be notified and asked to quarantine. Her exact relationship with the case is not important. Remember, everyone should have access to contact tracing services. They should know that they've been exposed, and they should be asked to quarantine. It doesn't matter how they know the case. It doesn't matter in what context that contact occurred. Should you tell his wife about his girlfriend? Well, no. This is private information that the case shared with you. You're not allowed to disclose it to anyone. You can only use it for contact tracing purposes. So you can see here, you're using it for contact tracing purposes because you're going to call the girlfriend. She's a contact. She needs to know that she's exposed and she needs to quarantine. But you can't use the information for anything else, only for contact tracing purposes. 

![2020-06-11_00-47-05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45191356/84820874-1b570400-afcf-11ea-9c6f-2625146bce41.png)

So now, let's think of another example that might be tricky to handle, when you hear private information about someone you know. Let's imagine that during an interview with a COVID-19 case, he tells you about the people that he had contact with at a party, and some of those people went to high school with your younger brother. This could happen, because contact tracers are often people who live in the communities that they're helping, so it's possible that you could in the course of your job come into contact with private information about someone you know. So if you heard this, you may be alarmed that there could be people with COVID-19 in your community. So should you warn your younger brother not to have contact with his friends, because they may have had contact with this case? Well, the answer here is, no, because you cannot not disclose any private information you learned during contact tracing, even to your family members or friends. What you learn in contact tracing and case investigations has to stay within that realm. It has to stay in your professional life. You can't discuss it with anyone else except for the purposes of contact tracing. Now, let's talk about another scenario that you could encounter as a contact tracer, and that is when the case or a contact is an undocumented worker. 
So let's say, for example, during an interview with an elderly COVID-19 case, she tells you that one of her close contacts is her helper, who comes to her house three times a week to help clean and cook. So you find that helper. You interview the helper, and she tells you that she provides these services to two other elderly patients each week as well. She also tells you that she is undocumented, and when you ask her to quarantine for the next 14 days, she says that she cannot because if she doesn't work, she doesn't get paid. So two questions for you, how might you try to convince the woman about quarantine, and should you call the immigration or police because she's undocumented? 
OK, so the answer to the first one, how should you convince her to quarantine? First, you should offer to put her in touch with organizations that might be able to help or get food or other assistance while she stays home, since if she can't work she doesn't get paid. So there may be some support for her there. You should also remind her the people she's caring for are at high risk for death if they get infected from her, so it's really important that she quarantine. In some places, you may also be able to require her to quarantine, and it might be enforced. So if you're in a jurisdiction were that's an option, you may need to tell her this. Now, should you call the immigration or the police because she's undocumented? The answer is, no. 

> *The fact that she's an undocumented worker is private information, and it's irrelevant for the contact tracing effort. It's not important for contact tracing effort.*

What's important is, that she quarantine so she doesn't infect other people. But this has no relationship with whether or not she's an undocumented worker. So, no, you don't have the right to disclose that kind of private information to anyone else. [MUSIC PLAYING]

## Video: Examples of Technology Used for Each Step
SPEAKER: In this section, we're going to talk about some of the technology that's used for contact tracing, the rationale for using it, and also maybe some of the ethical implications because technology can be used to identify and communicate private information or confidential information. So let's talk through this a little bit. So first, what's the rationale for using technology for contact tracing? First, public health staff time is often very limited. So contact tracers have a difficult job. And so anything we can do to help with their workload could be really useful. 

> *The timing of events is very important in contact tracing for COVID-19.*

We have to reach people very quickly in order to help them. So we need all the help we can get with this. Technology can improve our efficiency and the speed of some of the public health functions, including contacting people. And it can meaningfully. But the technology we use should meaningfully improve the process of contact tracing, case investigations, and follow up without creating new major difficulties to solve. So we should use technology when it helps us in our efforts as long as it's not creating other big problems.
So I want to just remind you of the timeline of infection and particularly when people are infectious, and remind you that this window of opportunity to identify contacts and ask them to quarantine is pretty small. We've got to be really quick. And again, this is just to explain to you why we need to think about all the possible tools we could use like technology to make this process as quick as possible. [MUSIC PLAYING]

## Video: Examples of Technology Used for Each Step
SPEAKER: So if technology can help us in case investigations and contact tracing, let's go through some examples and how it can be used in each step. So as we think about technology, we should think about technology that can be used in each of the basic steps for case investigation and contact tracing. So, first, when we interview the case and are assessing their symptoms, we're asking them to isolate and providing support, and recalling information about contacts, so there's some technology we can use there. There's some technology that we may be able to use for notifying contacts, and some additional technology we could use for interviewing the contact. And that includes, again, assessing symptoms, ongoing tracking, and asking them to quarantine and provide support. First, let's talk about electronic case reporting. So when a patient or when someone gets tested for COVID-19, their information is typically entered into some kind of electronic system, because that system is how their information will be linked with their test result. So usually in a jurisdiction, there's a central database where positive test results are reported from the lab. It's going to vary by region exactly how this works, but, usually, there'll be some database that has a list of people and their information who have had a test. And then, when the test results come back from the lab, they'll link up there. And that's where you identify cases.

One problem at this step, is that it can take time to gather data and information on cases for investigations. So if you're doing this manually, looking in one place for patient information, looking in another place for the test results, it can take some time. So one solution, one technological solution, is an automated standardized reporting of positive tests to the case investigators. So there are some applications that have been developed to make this more of an automated process, so that you don't have to go looking through the databases to find cases individually. They'll just be reported out in more of an automated way. The added value of this, is that there's less time between the diagnosis, or when the test results come back, and the call from the public health team. So as a contact tracer, sometimes you'll just be given the list that's already put together of the cases that you need to identify and make contact with. And that often comes from an electronic case reporting system. 

> *As you'll recall, a really important step in case investigations and in keeping in touch with contacts is tracking of symptoms.*

It's important for cases because if they develop worsening symptoms, that could require medical care, sometimes urgent medical care. You also need to know about their symptoms because you need to know when they've recovered and when they can end isolation. For contacts, it's important to identify if they develop signs or symptoms and need care or if they develop signs and symptoms and maybe to get access to a test because they may have become a COVID-19 case. 

For both cases and contacts, it's important to track symptoms. Now the problem here is that no conventional way to do this is a daily call. So you would call cases and contacts every single day to follow up with them, and that can be time consuming for the contact tracer and also for the cases and contacts themselves to have this call every day. 

One solution-- technological solution-- that has been proposed is there are applications where cases and contacts can directly enter symptoms into a database. Sometimes there are also text messages that can be sent to contacts in cases to report new or worsening symptoms. And sometimes this is automated. So in some places, for example, each case and contact may get a text message every day to ask if they have a fever that day and if so, what their temperature was. That could save some time. 

You don't have to call them, and it's a more convenient way for them to enter in their symptoms each day and track them. Of course, these are going to vary by jurisdiction, but we just want you to know that these are some applications that are used in some places. The added value of this kind of technological tool for tracking symptoms is that there's less time required by the contact tracing team and, again, sometimes less time for cases and contacts. But the cases and contacts should always know that they can pick up the phone anytime and talk to their contact tracer or the local public health department if they need assistance. This doesn't replace the role of discussions and phone calls between contact tracers and cases and contacts, but it just helps it along if you don't need that daily conversation. As you know, asking people to isolate themselves and quarantine is asking a lot of people, and some people may require help with doing this. They may need help getting food or medicine to support quarantine, for example, and people are going to be more likely to isolate themselves in quarantine if they get more reminders. The problem here again is that if you're making daily calls to cases and contacts, it can be time consuming for them and for you. So one solution-- one technological solution that's been proposed-- is that text messages could be sent to cases and contacts to remind them every day that they're still in isolation or they're still in quarantine and remind them of what that means. Those automated messages can also provide them information about where and how to get support services if they need them. That can be useful because even though a contact may not need help the first time you talk to them, a few days later, they may realize that they do need some help with food or other services. 

It's important for them to know every day where they can go if they need that service. The added value of this kind of automated communication is that it can require less time, like for the contact tracing team, and cases and contacts also get very frequent follow up. If you're supposed to be doing this by phone and the team is running behind, sometimes you could miss getting cases and contacts important information. 

This makes sure that nothing slips through the cracks. It's always very challenging to identify contacts quickly. There can be numerous difficulties with identifying contacts quickly. First, cases may not remember all of their contacts, or they may not want to talk about their contacts with the interview, due to their own privacy concerns. Cases may not know the phone number or the address of their contacts, and phone numbers for contacts may be incorrect. So it takes some time to get the right information from cases about their contacts, and even with your best efforts, you may not have always the information that you need. Once you have that information, it takes time to find those contacts and get in touch with them. Sometimes they may not pick up the first time you call. It may take extra effort. 

There are a few possible supportive technologies that you can think about or that you may use in your job that will help with this. If you've been following the news about the pandemic, you may have heard about some way that smartphones were used in other countries to quickly identify contacts. This kind of system is not being used in the United States, but we just want to talk to you about it so you know what the system is. And you can know how it's different than other types of systems that may be used in the US. 

In places like China and South Korea, they used a centralized database of phone numbers and locations. So in these countries, phone numbers of all the citizens are available to the government. They're unique identification numbers that each person has, and those are linked with all of their phone records and their medical records. And these are all maintained on a central server. 

The government can find any person, and for that person, they know their phone number. They can access their phone's data. So they know where they were, and they also have their medical records. So health authorities can quickly link positive test results with their recent contacts and locations using the GPS data from their phones. So in this kind of scenario, when the government has all of the data linked together about you, if you have a positive test, they can quickly send text messages to all the people you've been in contact with because they know, based on your phone and the GPS records, where you've been, and they know from the GPS records of everyone else's phone who was there at the same time.

The added value of this system, of course, is that all the contact information and contact tracing is done immediately. So public health has easy access to all the information, and they can send out text messages quickly to everyone who was at the same place that you were if you become a case. But this technology does bring in added concerns. So in many countries, people would not agree to having their movements tracked in a centralized database by the government. And this is true of the United States. There is no place now for the government to track our movements via our phone. And the other concern is that a GPS location is not a great way to identify who you had contact with. 

Let's say just because you were in the same shop with someone for a few minutes, that may not mean that you were really exposed to them. So it's not a great way to identify who's had a potentially infectious contact. So again, this isn't a system that's being used in the US or proposed in the US, but it is a system that was used in other countries to combat COVID-19. In the United States, however, there are some efforts to try to design applications that could use smartphones to identify who you've had contact with. 

The idea here is that smartphone users could download an application onto their phone, and that application will communicate with other phones that also have the app. They'll use Bluetooth technology to communicate that you've been in contact, and in contact, we mean again within six feet for about 15 minutes or so just as an example. And so what happens is if a lot of people download this app, as you go about your day, you will come into contact with other people who also have that app on their phones. And so the apps on the phones will recognize each other and send a little message that says, hey, we were in contact for this amount of time. You won't be able to know any information about who that person is. The app will not collect any information about who the person is or where the contact happened. 

There's no private or confidential information here. It's just keeping know of which other phones have been in contact with you. So it's basically just a list of those phones if they have the app on them. So then if you or someone else who had this app was diagnosed with COVID-19, you could enter the information in the app, and the app would immediately notify all the other contacts you had automatically if they had the app as well. 

The added value with this kind of system is that contacts are notified of their exposure immediately-- well, at least as soon as a person who's infected puts that information into their app-- and then they would be advised to quarantine. So ideally, you're be cutting out some of the time that it might take public health to find you and let you know. Also the identity of the case and their contacts is always kept confidential because you don't know who it was in particular that you had contact with who was infected. This app could be useful, but there are still some added concerns. 

It's unclear how the data could be used by public health teams, and the effectiveness of this contact tracing effort would depend on the number of people who use the app. So if you live in a place where no one's really using the app, then it's not going to be that useful. Also, not all of the contacts that are identified through the application may truly have been exposed. So that would be another complicating factor. 

We're still waiting to see how that might be done. I want to walk through with you just a timeline of what that notification app might look like. So you can see or think about how it might really work. So let's imagine this is you at home in the circle, and you have your smartphone. And you have the app on your smartphone. And the two people you live with also have the app on their smartphone. So when you're together in the home, those apps will be communicating with each other, and they will know that you have had contact with each other. Let's say you get on a train to go to work. You'll have some close contacts-- so people who were within six feet of you while you're on the train. You may also have people who are proximate contacts. So they're near you, maybe more than six feet away, but you're on the train together for, let's say, an hour on your commute. So their phones may also tell them that they've had proximate contact with you. When you go to work, you may also have other close contacts or nearby contacts. So people are who are in the same space with you for your workday, even if you did not come within six feet of them, if they have the apps on their phone, their apps are also logging their contact with you through the app. The same is true when you get back home that day. So let's imagine the next day, when you're back at home, you wake up with a fever, and you're sick. So you could put that information into your app, and it would notify both your close physical contacts and people who've been near you and tell them that they should quarantine. 
 
![2020-06-11_00-52-48](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45191356/84830170-d38ba900-afdd-11ea-8984-a9f32727cfd1.png) 
 
You can see how this would speed up the communication process with close and nearby contacts, but you need to be sure of a few things, including the person entering the information really has COVID-19. So this application information would need to be linked with public health and the test results. You'd also need to know who those contacts are so that public health can follow up with them and make sure that they have all the quarantine and isolation instructions they need and also the social support they may need to carry out isolation and quarantine. So when we think about these technologies that could be useful, there are a few important considerations to keep in mind. 

> *Effective public health interventions depend on public trust.* 

Any kind of technology that we use to support case investigations and contact tracing has to be a method that's trusted by the public, and they have to know that it's being done to support them. Sometimes we want to use technology to help contact tracing efforts, but some communities may have limited access to these technological tools. Some people may not have smartphones. Many people may not have good internet at home. So any kind of technology that we use should be usable and should be applicable for the people that we're trying to help. Finally, just knowing about being near someone who had a positive COVID-19 test and being asked to quarantine by text message really might not be enough to persuade people to act. So while sometimes these technological tools can help public health-- maybe they make notifications faster-- they really can't replace the role of public health and supporting people through isolation and quarantine-- so just keep this in mind. 

## Video: Summary
OK. Let's summarize briefly what we learned about the ethics of contact tracing and some of the technological tools. So contact tracing is a public good. It's been used to reduce the risk to the public from infectious diseases for a century for diseases like tuberculosis. Contact tracing must strike a balance between individual rights of privacy, autonomy and confidentiality, and the greater public good. And contact tracers have to be sensitive to that balance and be attentive to the issues of privacy and confidentiality when interviewing cases and their contacts. So remember, contact tracers will have access to private and confidential information, but they can only use it for the purposes of contact tracing. They can't disclose it outside the people who need to know for contact tracing purposes.
