# Module 6
## Video: The Importance of Rapport
EMILY GURLEY: Hi. My name is Emily Gurley. And I'm an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Now, that you know about contact tracing, what it is, all the steps, and all the basic principles. Now, it's time to talk about the how. How can you be most effective in your communication with cases and contacts to get your job done? We're going to offer you some skills in this module. By the end of this lecture, you should be able to describe the meaning and the importance of building rapport. You should be able to explain some ways that you can have more effective communication with cases and contacts. You should understand the difference between different question types, such as open questions versus closed questions. You should be able to describe what it means to be an active listener. You should be able to explain the four basic types of human communication, and how they apply to contact tracing. And, finally, you should be able to describe and troubleshoot some common difficulties with case investigation and contact tracing. Let's start at the beginning with the importance of rapport. What does rapport mean? Rapport is a feeling of mutual understanding, trust, and agreeableness between people. At the end of the day, to be effective as a contact tracer, you will have to have a good rapport with the cases and the contacts that you speak with. If you are able to successfully build rapport with cases and contacts, then you'll be able to ask for and get accurate information. You'll be able to provide them with education about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, important information that they're going to need to know. It's important for their health and for the health of others. If you build effective rapport, you should be able to persuasively ask for them to follow isolation and quarantine instructions. Isolation and quarantine are difficult to do well. And if you have a good rapport with them, you're going to improve the chances dramatically that they feel like they can effectively isolate and quarantine themselves. So rapport is central to everything that contact tracers do. 

> *Building rapport is very important.* 

And so, you want to know how to have an effective call, how to have effective communication with a case or a contact. In the rest of this presentation, we're going to talk to you about tips for effective communication, types of questions that you'll need to know. We'll talk to you about what active listening means, and provide you with an overall communication framework so you can understand the type of communication that you're having with the case or the contact. At the end of the day, this is all about connecting with people. You should be empathetic. You should always use a compassionate tone. A good attitude will always improve the quality of a call.

## Video: Tips for Effective Communication
SPEAKER 1: Let's start with some tips for effective communication. First, you should strive to be assertive-- not aggressive and not passive. So something in between. Let's talk a bit about the differences between being assertive, passive, and aggressive. So someone who is assertive is confident, direct, and also reassuring. Passive means accepting without questioning or pushing back at all. And aggressive means being intense or overly harsh, or eager to fight or disagree. So we want to be assertive, not passive, not aggressive. Here are some examples of what that might look like in a conversation with a case. So let's imagine the case says, why should I stay home or tell you who I've seen recently? Below that are three possible answers. One that's assertive, one that's passive, one that's aggressive. 
 
![2020-06-11_00-58-53](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45191356/84830498-4eed5a80-afde-11ea-85a8-f58ef75cb7cc.png) 
 
So let's read through what these sound like. An assertive response, or a good response, would be, you'd like to know why I'm asking you to stay at home? Well by staying separated you're helping your loved ones and community stay safe. We strongly recommend that you, and lots of other people like you, stay home so that we can stop the spread. A passive response-- which isn't good-- would be something like this, oh, well you don't need to if you don't want to. So you'd want to be more assertive. An overly aggressive response might sound something like this-- you have to stay home, because we said you have to. And you should probably listen, because that's what's good for you and your kids. So this one is overly aggressive, and it might have the unintended consequences of breaking down rapport. And really you want to have a good rapport. You want a good communication with the case. 

> *It's important to always use simple words and avoid technical terms that people may not understand.*

So some technical words to avoid using are "case", "contact", or "infectious period." You now know what these words mean, but not everyone does. So it's better to use simpler phrases. Some examples of simpler phrases you could use are instead of case you could say, someone who's sick. Instead of a contact you could say, someone who's been around a sick person. Instead of infectious period you could say something like, the time in which we can spread coronavirus to others. So let's imagine you call a contact, and the person who answers the phone asks why are you calling me? Don't say, well, you came in close contact with a case during your infectious period. They might not understand. A better way to say that could be, I'm calling to let you know that you were recently around someone who tested positive for coronavirus. Because you spent some time with them, you may also get sick. 

> *Another important communication tip is communicate just one message or one question at a time.*

When you ask multiple questions at the same time it can sometimes confuse people. Or you may get a response back that doesn't give you the clear answer that you need. If you include just one message at a time, then you'll be better able to meet your goals to both get information and also give information. Sometimes people take time to process new information while you're talking. So if you give just one message at a time, it allows them time to understand what you're asking or what you're saying. So it improves the overall quality of your conversation. It also gives you the chance to check in frequently and see if they've understood you. So an example of how not to do it might be to ask a case this question-- do you have a fever, any shortness of breath, or a cough? You've asked multiple things at once. If they respond yes, then you're not sure which one they had. Is it all three? Is it just one? A better way to do it would say, do you have fever? Or to ask, what symptoms have you had since you got sick last Monday? Then they could list them all out for you. So again, in summary, it's best to ask just one question at a time. You're very lucky, because you have many, many decades of experience in contact tracing helping you become a contact tracer. And there are some really common pitfalls that happen with communication, with contacts, and with cases. So let's review some of these so that you can avoid them. Some common pitfalls are that you're going too slowly or too quickly. Another pitfall could be that you sound unfriendly or that you're bored or annoyed. If you talk too quietly, they may not be able to hear you. If you talk too loudly, they may not like that either. Interrupting others is another common pitfall that you definitely want to avoid. And finally, don't offer any personal opinions. This is a time just to provide them with facts. You should also recognize and know the limits of what you know, and refer people to a health care worker for medical advice. You'll often get a lot of questions about medicine, people who are concerned about their health and want answers. But you're not the right person to provide that, so be sure they know who they can contact about their medical questions. Let's say, for example, that a contact asks you, so you're saying that I've been near someone while they were sick with COVID-19. Well, do you think I should be worried if I have diabetes? Don't tell them, “I don't think you should worry about that. It doesn't seem important.” You don't really know. It's best that they talk with their doctor. So you could say instead, “You know, that's not something I'm an expert on. I suggest that you chat with your doctor about that.” And then you could even follow up to make sure they have someone that they can talk to. Now you're going to see a conversation between Larry and Drew, who's a contact tracer. This conversation doesn't go very well. So see if you can spot some of the errors that Drew made, and we'll talk about them next. 

DREW: Hi. Larry? \
LARRY: Hello. This is Larry. Who is this? \
DREW: Hi. I'm from the health department. I'm calling about your recent lab test. Could you confirm your birthday for me? 1949, right? And your address. \
LARRY: Well, actually it's 1947. October 25, 1947. And I live it 510 Gale Drive. DREW: Great. Well, I'm calling to let you know that you're a case of coronavirus, and you're probably still in your infectious period. \
LARRY: Yeah. My doctor said the test was positive. But they didn't say there's a treatment yet. Do you know? \
DREW: I think they'll probably have one soon if they don't already. But listen, I'm just calling to let you know that you should stay inside. And you have to, because we said you do. \

SPEAKER 1: OK. Now let's review what happened with the conversation with Drew and Larry? So first, you can see where Drew says, hi, I'm from the health department. He didn't really introduce himself well, and he also interrupted Larry who is in the middle of a sentence. He asked for Larry's birthday and address at the same time. And remember, you want to ask questions separately. Next, Larry gave his birthday and his address, but then Drew explained why he was calling, but he used technical terms like "case" and "infectious period." And you shouldn't do that. Larry may not understand what you're talking about. Next Larry, rightly so, is asking about a treatment. He's curious and wants to know. But Drew shouldn't really offer an opinion, because he's not sure about treatments for COVID-19. And then he was a bit aggressive in explaining about how Larry should stay inside. So again, you want to be assertive, but not too aggressive to be sure that you're having the most effective communication as possible. Now let's listen to another scenario. And in this scenario, Amy is the contact tracer and she's having a conversation with Larry. And this one goes much better, because she's using all the tips of effective communication. We'll review that after you're done. 

AMY: Hello. May I please speak with Larry Murray? \
LARRY: This is Larry. Who is this? \
AMY: Hi, this is Amy Jones from the health department. I'm calling about your lab test from last Monday. Is now a good time? \
LARRY: Yeah, that. Yes, now is OK. \
AMY: Thanks, Larry. Before we keep talking, I just need to check your date of birth. I have here that you were born in 1947? \
LARRY: Yes, October 25th. \
AMY: Great. Great. So I'm calling you today because you were tested for coronavirus. Has someone already called you to talk about the results? \
LARRY: Yeah. I was positive. My doctor said you might be calling, but he didn't mention any treatments. Anyway, how can I help you? \
AMY: Yeah. Well your doctor would be the best person to ask about any treatments. I'm just here to check on you, give you some instructions, and ask a few follow up questions. We're calling everybody who tests positive to make sure that they and our communities have what they need to stay safe. So sound OK to you? \
LARRY: Yes. I understand. Thank you. \

SPEAKER 1: All right. So that call went a lot better, didn't it? You can see that Amy introduced herself and quickly stated why she was calling, and checked that now was the best time to talk. She asked one question at a time, and she thanked the case. Before saying the positive results and confirming that with Larry, Amy asked the case what they already knew. Often they may have heard from their medical provider before you call them. In this scenario, Amy didn't offer up any information about treatment, and didn't respond defensively, even though Larry was upset. Amy continued to assert herself in a friendly way, but without being harsh. This is a good example of some language that you might use also on your calls. Also note when you listen to this call that the interviewer wasn't going too slowly or too quickly. The pace felt just right.

## Video: Question Types and When to Use Them
SPEAKER: Now let's talk about different types of questions and when to use them. As a part of every call, you're going to collect information from cases and contacts. And the way that people respond to you is going to depend on how you word the question. So asking questions in different ways can help collect information more effectively. Question types can also be used together, as you'll see on the next slide, where we go through all the different question types. So there are five question types, closed, open, probing, checking, and leading. 

![2020-06-11_01-11-00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45191356/84831281-ebfcc300-afdf-11ea-9ecc-d9a1682820b4.png)
 
A closed question is used to limit answer choices. And there can be both good or bad closed questions. A bad closed question, for example, would force someone to choose between two answers that may not represent their experience. An open question is used to generate descriptive answers that require more than one word. And so open-ended questions allow people to respond however they feel is appropriate. 

> *Probing questions are an important tool, and they are used as a follow-up question to get more information about a person's response.*

An example of a probing question is, can you tell me more? You're seeking more information. A checking question is used to confirm that you heard correctly. And you know that for effective communication, you need to be regularly checking in with the person you're talking to to make sure that you've heard correctly what they've said, and they've heard correctly what you said. 
So checking questions are good for that. Leading questions are typically ones that you want to avoid because they're guiding people into believing that they should answer in a certain way. We'll go over some examples of what these kinds of different types of questions look like. So let's imagine now that you're asking about symptoms, you're having a conversation with a case. Here are some examples of all the different types of questions that you could use asking about symptoms. 
So a close question about symptoms would be, do you still have a fever? Right? So this is closed because there are only two answers, yes or no. An open question about this would be, what sorts of symptoms have you had since becoming ill? To answer that question, they could provide any of the symptoms that they felt were relevant. A probing question about symptoms would be something like this, so you said things have improved, can you tell me more about how you're feeling today? So you're asking that question to get more information based off of what they've told you. A checking question related to symptoms might sound like this, on Monday you said you had a fever, is that correct? So you're asking them to confirm what you think you've heard. A leading question on symptoms would be something like this, you must be feeling fine now, right? You can see from this leading question that the person is more likely to say, yes, even though maybe they're not really feeling fine. So leading questions, again, are typically ones that you want to avoid. Now let's go through these different question types again, this time in the scenario of asking about a case's contacts. So when asking someone about what they've been doing for the past several days, you may need to ask many questions. Generally a closed question will not work in this scenario. You'll need to help people remember by walking through each day and having them get out their phones or their calendar. So a closed-ended question here might be, have you spent an extended amount of time with anyone without a mask in the past three days? So again, it's closed. They can either answer it yes or no. An open question would be, how have you been spending your time this week since you've become sick? What about the two days before becoming sick? That's another open question. A tip here is you can ask people to check their calendars, text messages, and social media for help remembering what they did. 

![2020-06-11_01-16-32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45191356/84831504-45fd8880-afe0-11ea-9aea-e9832e764d51.png)
 
If you wanted to ask a probing question about someone's contacts, you might say something like this, oh, you went walking. Well, did you chat with anyone on the way? That might help jog their memory. A checking question about contacts would be something like this, oh, OK, you said you didn't live with anyone. Is that correct? If you wanted to just confirm. A leading question might be, so I can assume you didn't see anyone? See, they're leading you to say, “No, no, I didn't see anyone.” A better way to find out about contacts is through probing or open-ended questions. 
In this vignette, you're going to hear again about Larry and Drew, the contact tracer. And Drew misses some opportunities to apply different question types that could be more effective. After watching this interaction, let's follow up and we'll see what mistakes Drew made. 

DREW: Thanks for telling me about your symptoms. Now, I'd like to understand about what you did and who you saw over the past week. You didn't see anyone, right? \
LARRY: Well, no. \
DREW: Got it. Did you do anything? \
LARRY: No, like I said, I haven't done anything except stay at home, just like everyone else. 
DREW: OK, thanks for letting me know. \
LARRY: Yeah. \

SPEAKER: So in this vignette, Drew is interviewing Larry about his contacts. You can see at the beginning were he says, you didn't see anyone, right? He's using a leading question, and that could cause Larry to feel like he should answer in a certain way. And Larry answers, well, no. Then Drew asked a closed question as a follow-up, doesn't help Larry think through the details of their activities. He just says, did you do anything? So let's take a look now at another vignette of a better way to ask these types of questions. In this vignette, you're going to hear about Larry's conversation with Amy. Amy uses many different types of questions in a more effective way to understand who Larry may have had contact with. After you watch this vignette, we'll follow up and see what Amy did. 

AMY: All right, Larry, thanks for telling me about your symptoms. So now I'd like to understand a bit about what you did and who you saw over the past week. \
LARRY: OK, well, like I said, I haven't done anything except stay at home, just like everyone else. [COUGHS] \
AMY: OK, so you've been staying at home. Earlier you said that when you started feeling sick, you went to the doctor. Did you take the train there? \
LARRY: No, I had my truck. \
AMY: OK, so you took your truck, you drove over to the doctor, and then you came on back. What did you do when you got back from the doctor's? \
LARRY: Well, I ran into my neighbors on the way back and just chatted with them for a while. It was good, then I went home and just got some rest. \
AMY: OK. OK, so you ran into your neighbors on your way home, and then what did you do for the rest of the day? \
LARRY: I just chilled on the couch.\

SPEAKER: So as you heard, Amy use some closed and probing questions to determine whether Larry had used public transportation at all when he went to the doctor. After that, she used further probing questions to uncover more about the activities that he did during the day. And you can see after that probing question, Larry did remember some other activities. And it's important to understand these activities because that will give you a more complete list of who his contacts were. And finally, Amy asked another probing question to encourage Larry to go through even in more detail what he did for the rest of the day. So these are the types of probing questions you want to ask in this kind of scenario to have a more effective communication and a more complete list of Larry's contacts.

## Video: Active Listening – Helping People Feel Heard
SPEAKER: A crucial part of building and maintaining rapport is active listening, or helping people feel like they're being heard. Active listening is really important, because it tells the case or the contact that you're hearing them. It deepens your rapport with them, and creates space for them to tell you more details. And again, you need those details. Those are important details that you're going to need to do your job and to reduce the risk of transmission in your community. So it's important that you get this right. 

> *Active listening will also help you develop a relationship that will be important for the future check-ins that you're going to have with them.*

So remember, your first call with a case or contact is just that-- it's just the first. You're going to be calling this person back, often, many times throughout the course of their illness or their quarantine period, so it's good to get off on the right foot. When you're actively listening, you're listening not only to what people are saying, but also trying to understand what they're feeling, and you also want to leave enough silence in the conversation for them to open up and say more-- if they're ready to do so. Active listening means that you are making a conscious effort to hear a person's words and their underlying message without judgment. So to actively listen, you should also be affirming what you've heard. Some ways to do that are to paraphrase. So paraphrasing means repeating what was just said to you, but using your own words. So you could say something like, "What I'm hearing is," or "It sounds like," or "You said," and then repeating what you think that they said. That way, when they hear what they've told you coming back to them, they can be reassured that you're actively listening to what they say. You can also reflect. And reflecting is putting words to the emotions being expressed to you. So not only hearing what they're saying, but trying to communicate what you think the person is also feeling. Silence is another good tool. Being totally quiet, or offering small words like, "uh-huh," "mm-hmm," so the other person can finish talking or work out a thought, is really important. That allows the space in the communication for other things to come up, and for the case or contact to process the conversation and the questions being asked, and provide accurate information. Let's look at some examples of what this might mean. So here's an example of what paraphrasing might sound like. Let's say you're on the call with a contact, and they say, "I walked on the beach, but it was empty that morning. No one in sight." You might respond with, "What I'm hearing is that you didn't come across anyone on your walk." So you're rephrasing what they said so that they feel heard. Here's an example of what reflecting might sound like. So the contact could say, "I'm tired, and this whole interview is too much. You're asking me too many questions." The contact tracer might say something like this. "I hear you. This interview feels overwhelming, and is exhausting to you." So they're communicating not just what the contact said, but they're also trying to communicate what the contact is feeling, and the underlying message and emotion in what they've said. So by reflecting this back to the contact, the contact can feel heard and understood. In this next vignette, you're going to see Drew and Larry again. And as usual, Drew is not using best practices for active listening. After you watch this, we'll come back and see some of the mistakes that Drew made. 

DREW: All right, so we reviewed what isolation means, and we made a plan for how you're going to protect yourself, your friends, and your family. \
LARRY: Right. Thanks for that. Just to say that this has really been hard for. Me I usually take care of my mother, and I haven't been able to see her for our weekly dinners. \
DREW: Yeah. I completely know what you mean, but, I mean, sorry. I can't help you with that. And if there isn't anything else you want to talk about related to your illness, I think that's it for me. So thank you for your time, and chat with you again soon. \

SPEAKER: So in this vignette, you heard Larry say that the isolation has been very difficult for him, and he's implying that he's feeling sad. Unfortunately, Drew ignores this. But he should have reflected back emotion to show Larry that he heard what he was saying, and he heard that he was feeling sad. That would really go a long way in improving the rapport between Drew and Larry. In this vignette, let's hear how Amy would do it differently. She's going to be using active listening. After you watch this video, we'll come back and review what Amy did well and give you some pointers on how you can be an active listener in your conversations, too. 

AMY: All right, Larry, so during the call we've already reviewed what isolation means, and we've made a plan together for how you're going to protect yourself, your friends, and your family. Anything else? \
LARRY: Right. Thanks for that. And just to say that this has been really hard for me. I usually take care of my mother, and I haven't been able to see her. She's 90. I don't know if I'll ever see her again. \
AMY: Yeah. Sounds like you're scared about the future, and you're missing your mom and just really having a hard time, Larry. \
LARRY: Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Thank you for talking with me. It was really nice. \
AMY: Thank you, and I'm really glad to talk with you today, too. Before I go, do you have any questions that you'd like to ask me? \
LARRY: No. I think I'm good-- for now. \
AMY: OK. OK, Larry. But listen, me or one of my colleagues are going to be back in touch real soon, just to check on that fever and see if it's improved, and I'm crossing my fingers for you. So chat soon. \
LARRY: I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Be well. \
AMY: All right, you too, Larry. Bye, bye. \
LARRY: Bye. \

SPEAKER 1: So in this vignette, Amy did a few things that Drew didn't do. Amy reflected back to Larry using her own words to describe that Larry was feeling sad, to make sure that he knew he was being heard. Amy also used silence to let Larry communicate some of his thoughts and feelings. That improved their rapport. Amy also used Larry's name. That can be used to create familiarity and, again, build rapport and trust with the person you're talking to. Remember, you're going to be talking to these people more than once. At the end of the call, Amy summarized what they had talked about, and had a very friendly, personable demeanor. That's a nice way to close out a call.

## Video: Bringing it all together into one communication framework
INSTRUCTOR: So now you know some tips for communication. You know about different types of questions and how to be an active listener. So let's bring that all together into one communication framework. So there's this idea that all communication between two people can basically be broken down into four types-- observations, feelings, needs, and requests. So an observation is, without judgment, noticing what is happening for that person or for you. Feelings are when emotions are being expressed or felt or communicated by you or them. And those emotions could be fear, calm, annoyance, or joy. Needs are requirements for living a good life, like physical well-being, independence, safety, the need to be understood or understand someone else. A request is what you want from some other person or what they want from you. So within this communication framework, communication between two people is best when it includes empathic listening, active listening, and honest expression. In your conversations, we encourage you to think about every statement and what it's meant to convey. Is it an observation? Is it a feeling? Is it a need or a request? And that includes what you say to a case or contact and also what they're saying back to you. So if we apply this framework, then we can think about each statement, and we can put it into one of these categories. So let's give this some practice. What if a contact says, I can't stay home for two weeks? I need to see my kids and make sure they're all right. So they're, in that sentence, directly expressing a need. You may say, I hear you when you say you need your kids to be OK. You're paraphrasing the need. The contact could say, then, they're who I live for. What if I can't? In this statement, they're indirectly expressing their fear, which is an emotion. Then you should reflect that emotion. You could say, you're scared that you won't be able to provide. Then the contact may express an explicit request. Yes. What am I supposed to do? They're asking for advice. You could reflect back and observe their request. You could say, you're needing guidance. Would you be willing to let me refer you to some people who could help? So you are observing what they've said and offering to answer their request. So this framework can be a useful way for you to think about your communications, categorize different statements, and make sure that you're meeting the needs of communication for cases and contacts. In this next vignette, you're going to hear Drew, the contact tracer, talking with Anette. Drew wasn't using the communication framework very well. After you watch this vignette, we'll come back and review how it went. 

ANETTE: I'm really worried that my friends are all going to get sick. Do you know if they're going to be OK? \
DREW: That's not really why I'm calling. I just need to get some information from you to tell you how to quarantine yourself for the next two weeks. \
ANETTE: Two weeks? Well, I need to go shopping, and I need to go to work, and I just can't stay home for two weeks. So what am I supposed to do? \
DREW: That's what we're asking everyone to do who's been around with someone with coronavirus. \
ANETTE: Well, you're not helping. \

INSTRUCTOR: Well, as you saw, Drew really did not use the communication framework very well. He wasn't paying close attention to Anette here. He failed to hear her emotion or her requests for information about the severity of the disease. When she expressed some of her concerns, again, Drew didn't observe her emotions very well or her needs or her requests. And as you can see, it led to a breakdown in rapport between Drew and Anette. In this next vignette, you're going to hear a conversation between Amy, who is a contact tracer who does know how to use the communication framework, and her conversation with Anette. And you can see an alternative way for this conversation to go that's much more effective. We'll check back in after you've watched this vignette. 

ANETTE: I'm worried that all of my friends are going to get sick. Do you know if they're going to be OK? \
AMY: Yeah, you're scared for your friends, of course. You need to know they're going to be OK. For right now, let's just take this step by step. Why don't I tell you what I know, and then we can go from there? OK? \
ANETTE: All right. I mean, I really can't stay home if that's what you're going to ask me to do. I have bills I have to pay. \
AMY: I hear you. You need to make sure you've got enough to stay on top of things. I have some resources that might help if you'd be willing to let me share them with you later. \
ANETTE: Yeah, that would be really great. \
AMY: Thanks, so much Anette. This is a really difficult time, so I appreciate you talking with me today. And I'm hoping you can help answer a few questions for me. Would you be willing to do that? \
ANETTE: I guess so. \
AMY: Thanks again. So first things first, are you feeling sick at all today? \

INSTRUCTOR: In this example, Amy's communication was much more effective. She observed and reflected Anette's emotions, her needs, and her requests. Amy ended with a checking question. Here at the top you can see she said, why don't I tell you what I know, and then we can go from there? OK? So she's checking to make sure that Anette is in agreement as they continue the conversation. This is a great way to keep building rapport. Amy confirmed with Anette that she heard her, and she paraphrased some of Annette's emotions, like worry and fear, her need to pay bills. And she ends with some checking questions as well to make sure that Annette was following along with the conversation. Again at the end, Amy reflected back emotion and the request that Annette was making. By doing this, she was able to build enough rapport that she could continue the conversation with Anette and get some important information that she needed to really conduct an effective interview. 

## Video: Common Issue and Tips
SPEAKER 1: In this section, we're going to talk about some common issues that you may face in your communication with cases and contacts and some tips that you can use to overcome them. So despite your best efforts, there's no way around this, sometimes you're going to have issues with rapport. Sometimes, people will not want to talk to you. Sometimes people may not have known that their test was positive, and they may be caught off guard or be very scared when you tell them that their test was positive. Some people are impatient and may be tired by the length of the phone call and get annoyed with your questions, and some people with COVID-19 may not want to give you their close contacts phone number. These are common issues that you just need to be prepared for. It's good for you to keep some phrases in your back pocket, so to speak or have some phrases memorized that you can use frequently in your conversations with cases and contacts. Some of these might include phrases like, this is a difficult time. Many people that you talk to are going to be anxious, they're going to be worried, they're going to be afraid. So acknowledging that is going to be common. This is a difficult time is a good phrase to use. Another one you could use is everything is happening so fast. Some people feel a bit out of control with what's happening in their lives. Another good phrase is, I hear you, or I hear you when you say. This is a good way to acknowledge that you've heard what someone is saying, but you can't really say you understand them. We don't easily really know what it's like to be in someone else's shoes, so this is a good way to acknowledge that you're hearing what they're saying and supporting them. Mm-hmm. This is another way of encouraging them to keep speaking but letting them know you're there you're listening, and you can use phrases like right, of course, or absolutely to affirm what they're saying. There are some phrases that you should avoid, because they could block a good relationship from building and good rapport. Again, if you say I understand, that could sound superficial, because you really don't know this person, and you may really not understand what's happening, so there's no reason to use that phrase. I know conveys a similar meaning. So if you say, I know, they may also find this very superficial, because how could you know? You don't really know this person. Similar phrases are, I know what you mean, or I know how you feel. You should avoid these, because really truly, you probably don't know. Another phrase to avoid is, why did you do that, or why did you go there? It sounds pretty judgmental, and that's not good for building rapport. Again, you want to be actively listening but without judgment. Another common issue that you might face is someone rambling. Someone that you're talking to is talking a lot, and it makes it difficult for you to move the conversation along. So some strategies for this are to listen for a national pause. So if they stop to take a breath, that might be a good time to interject. You could also restate their last sentence in your own words just to show that you heard them. Sometimes people are talking a lot because they feel like you're really not listening, so sometimes if you can reassure them, that will help. Another way to deal with this would be to explain why you can't continue talking with them, and there has to be a limit on the conversation. That's just a way to explain why you need to move things along. Sometimes you may have to interrupt if things keep going on, because you do have to move on with your work. So one example might be let's say there's a caller who's talking to you, and they're going on about a story, and they say so then she never called me back so I could explain all the reasons why coronavirus is spreading everywhere, and then you insert yourself here. There's a brief pause, and you say, oh, I'm really sorry to interrupt. That sounds really frustrating-- so you're reflecting back their emotion-- that they didn't call you back, and I'm sorry. I wish that we could talk more about this, but as you know, there have been a lot of cases of COVID-19 Here, and we're trying to call them all. Would it be OK if we got back to your symptoms? So here, they're reflecting, the person is also explaining why they don't have time to keep talking about this issue but asking them to move on with the rest of the call. This would be a good way to handle this situation. SPEAKER 2: Hello. This is Amy calling from the Hillside Health Department. Is this Annette? SPEAKER 3: Yes, this is Annette. [COUGHING] SPEAKER 2: Hey, Annette. It sounds like you're not doing so hot. SPEAKER 3: Yeah, I mean, I'm not super sick like I need to go to the hospital, or anything.

## Video: Embracing Complexity
SPEAKER: In your role as a contact tracer, things are going to get complex. There's no way around this. You're trying to help people navigate their lives in very difficult circumstances. So you should embrace this complexity because it's an integral part of your job, but we're going to give you some advice on how to embrace that complexity and how to be as effective as possible in your job as a contact tracer. Being a contact tracer requires a great deal of skill and attention to detail. You have to be a good problem solver and creatively solve those problems. Contact tracers are equal parts detectives, investigators, social workers, and therapists. So in any given conversation, you may be playing all of these roles with a case or a contact. If at any time you come across a new situation or notice a specific issue that keeps coming up or something that you're just not sure how to handle, always reach out to your supervisor. That's what they're there for, and there will be many situations where you're going to need this help. When you identify a problem, first you need to define and understand what the problem is. Then you can generate some possible solutions. Sometimes you'll need help with that. Then select a solution that's going to work best, implement it, and then check in continuously to see if that solution is really solving the problem. And we're going to talk about problems in three areas of contact tracing. So the common areas that you may need to troubleshoot are with process, person, or context. Issues with process are problems that you have with following the contact tracing protocol. Issues with people are ones that involve difficult communication or issues with engaging with people. Issues with context are those that can't be solved by individuals themselves. So they may be problems that people are having, but they're really not under the control of that person, the person can't solve them.

## Video: Addressing Process Complexities
SPEAKER 1: First let's talk about some complexities with process and how you might address those. So remember that process issues are ones that prevent you from following exactly the protocol that you have for contact tracing. Here are just a few examples of what some issues with process might be. Let's say, for example, the contact becomes ill. So then, it's difficult to follow the contact tracing protocol with them, because now maybe they're a case. So it can be difficult to decide how to handle that conversation. Another possible issue could be that it just took a long time to find the contact. So by the time you talk to them, maybe most of their quarantine period is over or something like that. It could make it difficult for you to follow through on what you know you should do next. What if you call a case but they've now moved to another city or state? Well, that would be an issue, because then you'd have to identify and put them in touch with their local public health department. That could be a problem. Sometimes, information in your database about a case or a contact may be incorrect. That's a common issue. It just happens due to human error. But it can also be something that you'll need to be aware of. Sometimes, life just happens. Your computer may break, for example. Or maybe you need to call someone back, but it's the end of your shift, so it's going to make things difficult. In your job as a contact tracer, you're going to find many issues with following the protocol. These are just a few. But it's important to keep in mind that these are normal, it's a natural part of the job, and you just need to do your best to navigate through. Now I want to give you some best practices that will help you deal with all of these process issues. We couldn't even list all of the possible process issues that you may encounter. And we're not going to go one by one to tell you about how to solve each one, because it could depend on many different things. But in general, there are some things that you can do that are always going to help in any given situation. First, you should stay organized. You've got to record data carefully and write very detailed notes for you or others to follow. Remember, you're going to be following up with cases and contacts for a long time. It's likely that someone else may need to call them and know what you've talked with them about before. So detailed notes are really important. And you should always empathize. Practice reflective listening, provide reassurance. Because ultimately, if there are these issues with process, you're going to have to get through it together with the case or the contact. And any kind of empathy and good rapport that you can build with them is going to help everybody get through it more easily. Finally, always look to your local protocol and talk to your supervisor if you ever encounter a situation that you don't feel like you can confidently handle on your own. All right. Let's tackle just one example of an issue with process. Let's say you call a case, and they've already been contacted by the health department, and they're not really happy that you're calling again. So staying organized can help. So if they say they've already been contacted. You should check to see if there's already a record in the health department. If not, you should keep going with the call. Because it's possible they've been mistaken or something else may have happened. But you need the information. Collect the information that you need from the case, and then be sure to let your supervisor know and make notes in the call so you could try to troubleshoot later and maybe figure out what happened. You should empathize with the person. We can all understand what it would feel like to get multiple calls and feel like you're having to repeat information. You could say something like, I hear that you're frustrated. You should, of course, thank them for their time. In this next vignette, you're going to hear how Amy, the contact tracer, deals with a difficult situation, a more complex situation, with Annette. And Amy uses all of the best practices we've taught you about. So this will give you a good indication about what your complex conversations should sound like, too. 

AMY: Hello. This is Amy calling from the Hillside Health Department. Is this Annette? \
ANNETTE: Yes, this is me. Hi. \
AMY: Hey, Annette. It sounds like you're not doing too hot. \
ANNETTE: Yeah. I mean, I'm not super sick, like, I don't need to go to the hospital or anything. \
AMY: OK. Well, I'm here to talk with you about that. But before we go any further, just like you did last time with my colleague, Drew, I just need to confirm it's you. \
ANNETTE: OK. My birthday is August the 4th, 1958. And I live at 1994 Pebble Brook Circle in Hillside. 
AMY: Thanks, Annette. So first off, let's just talk about you. What's going on for you right now, symptom wise? \
ANNETTE: Well, after you called and told me that someone at choir had coronavirus, I just waited home like you told me. And then that weekend, I got a cough, and I started to feel just, you know. But my cough has mostly gone now. It lasted a few days now. But I just feel really, really, really tired, maybe a little feverish. \
AMY: I'm real sorry to hear that. It just sounds like you haven't been feeling your best. \
ANNETTE: Yeah. Thankfully, it's not too bad, though. Generally, I'm feeling better. \
AMY: Oh, good. Good, good, good. I'm glad to hear you're feeling better. \
ANNETTE: Thanks. \
AMY: All right. All right, well, since we know that you were around somebody with coronavirus, it's possible that that's also what you have. \
ANNETTE: I've been really worried about it. I've just been reading so much in the news about how bad this can be. \
AMY: Yeah. The news can be really scary. I hear you. \
ANNETTE: I mean, I've not gotten really bad. But who knows? \
AMY: Yeah. It's a difficult time, and it's tough to know what's going to happen. But we're here to check up on you. And we can take things step by step together. \
ANNETTE: OK. \
AMY: OK. So let's see. I have a list here of symptoms that might need immediate attention. And I can share that with you at the end of our call. And then that way, you can know what to be on the lookout for, OK? \
ANNETTE: Yeah. No, that's good. Thanks. \
AMY: All right. So let's just talk a little bit about how you've been feeling. I already have noted here that you've been feeling very, very tired like you said and that you've had a cough and maybe a bit feverish. But do you mind if I get some details about those and just go over a few more specific symptoms? \
ANNETTE: Yeah, that's fine. \
AMY: All right. Let me just note these. OK, so that cough-- about how many days have you had that cough? \
ANNETTE: About three days. \
AMY: OK, three days. And how many days ago did you start to feel feverish? \
ANNETTE: Maybe the last two. \
AMY: OK, last two days. \
ANNETTE: I never took my temperature though. \
AMY: That's OK, Annette. That's OK. Have you been feeling short of breath at all? \
ANNETTE: No, not really. I feel tired, but I'm not winded. \
AMY: OK, that's good. That's good to hear that. And let's see. Next, do you have any diarrhea? \
ANNETTE: No. \
AMY: All right. Excellent. And what about vomiting? \
ANNETTE: Nuh-uh. \
AMY: OK, good. No vomiting. And chills? \
ANNETTE: Nope. \
AMY: OK, no chills, and then this is last symptom here that I wanted to ask you about. How about a sore throat since you've been coughing? \
ANNETTE: Yeah, a bit. \
AMY: Yeah. Yeah. OK, thanks for going through those with me. So did you-- have you happened to call your doctor just to let them know that you're feeling this way and that you were around somebody with coronavirus? \
ANNETTE: Yeah. Yeah. She's arranging for me to get tested. But for now, she just said to stay home and let her know if things get any worse. \
AMY: OK, great. I'm glad you checked in with her. And since you have some symptoms that are similar to coronavirus, and you were around somebody who has coronavirus, we're just going to need to make a plan for you to continue staying at home and isolating yourself. That make sense? \
ANNETTE: Yeah. I mean, that's not really what I want to hear. Because I mean, I understand. I kind of figured it. But I haven't been able to work, and I just-- I can only do so much from home. \ 
AMY: Yeah. Yeah. I hear you, just there's only so much that you can do and get from at home. And well, we can definitely get you connected up with some resources so you're able to continue staying home. \
ANNETTE: Yeah. Thank you. I mean, you all did help me. You got me a note for work. And my daughter's still dropping off her groceries for me. In fact, I even had her take the dog right after I got off the phone with your colleague. \
AMY: Oh, good. I'm glad that she could take care of the dog. And everyone's just been able to help. When your daughter's coming over to bring your groceries, has she been staying outside of the apartment? \
ANNETTE: Yes. Yes, she has not been coming inside. We've not been close at all. You know, this is not easy. You know? \
ANNETTE: Yeah. Yeah, I hear you. It's just it can be really rough being apart from the people that we love. It sounds like you're close. Yeah. OK, well, the next couple of questions that I have for you might seem a little detailed. But I just need to understand how you've been spending your time, what you've been doing, and where you've been for the past couple of days. I heard you when you said that you were feeling real tired, but sometimes we forget. And it helps to just go through some previous text messages and see what we were doing. Would you be willing to do that with me? \
ANNETTE: Sure. Yeah. Let me grab my phone. \
AMY: Great. Thank you. \
ANNETTE: Yeah, got it. \
AMY: OK. OK, so why don't you just open that up and scroll back to what you were up to yesterday. And yeah. What's there? \
ANNETTE: OK. OK, my daughter sent me some pictures of my dog. I was at home. \
AMY: OK, so you're yesterday at home, seeing pictures of the dog. And what about the day before that? \
ANNETTE: Let's see. Well, I have a few messages from my friends. And they're just telling me that they hope I'm feeling better. \
AMY: That's sweet. OK, good friends. And any activities out and about that day? \
ANNETTE: No, no, just me messaging back how tired I am and how much sleeping I'm doing. 
AMY: Yeah. OK, well, I'm glad that you're getting some rest. And what about the days before that? Anything? \
ANNETTE: No, no. It's just some messages from my daughter. She's letting me know that she's making some new masks. And they're really nice. \
AMY: Awesome. What a talent. Yeah, mask making is kind of an art. OK, so nothing these past couple of days. And OK, we're almost done with this call. So I just have a couple more things to ask you. And I'm just real sorry that you're not feeling too hot. But since you aren't feeling well, yeah. We'd just like for you to start taking your temperature about twice a day, writing it down. And that way, we can just see if you have a fever, and if you do, how things are changing. \
ANNETTE: All right. I can do that. \
AMY: OK, thank you. And if you'd be willing to take note of any other symptoms that you notice, that'd be great too. OK? \
ANNETTE: Yep, I can do that. \
AMY: Wonderful. All right. Lastly, I promised that we'd talk about any worrying symptoms that you might need to call your doctor back about. Do you have something to write this down with? 
ANNETTE: Yeah, let me grab some paper. OK, got it. \
AMY: OK. \
ANNETTE: Ready. \
AMY: Ready? Ready. OK. OK, so the first one is shortness of breath. OK?A pressure in your chest that doesn't go away. \
ANNETTE: OK. \
AMY: OK. If you start to feel confused at all. \
ANNETTE: OK. \
AMY: OK. And this last one-- if your lips or face start to turn blue. \
ANNETTE: Oh, god. Really? \
AMY: Yeah. Yeah. Annette, listen. These symptoms are sort of the-- are an indicator that you need to get help right away. Most people have mild to moderate symptoms, and these are pretty rare. But we just-- we really just want you to be prepared if they do happen. And if they were to happen-- and obviously, we hope that they don't. But if they were to happen, we just want to let you know that you should call your doctor or 911 immediately and let them know that you were around someone who is positive. Like I said, we hope you don't need to, but that's just-- that's what we advise. Sound OK? \ 
ANNETTE: Yeah, that sounds good. \
AMY: OK, great. All right. Well, just looking down and that's really all I've got for right now. Do you have any questions for me? \
ANNETTE: No, I don't think so. \
AMY: OK, great. So our plan is just for you to continue staying home. You're going to take your temperature twice a day. Keep track of how you're feeling. And I'll make sure someone gets in contact with you about resources while you're not able to work. And then we'll just keep calling and see how you're doing, OK? ANNETTE: Yeah, that would be good. Thank you. \
AMY: OK, thanks so much, Annette. Really appreciate you chatting with me today. Take care. \

## Video: Addressing People Complexities
SPEAKER: In our next exercise in embracing complexity, we're going to talk about addressing complexities with people. As we discussed previously, you're going to have issues in working with people. And we're going to go through now some common issues that may be related to cases or contacts that you may encounter. We're not going to solve all of them, but let's just bring them up so you have some idea about the complexities that you may face in your job. So one issue could be that you're unable to speak with the case or the contact. That could be because they gave an invalid phone number, or maybe they've changed their phone number. You just can't reach them for whatever reason. Another issue could be that you can't reach a contact who's in quarantine. So they've been quarantined, but you're just not able to find them to follow up, for whatever reason. Language barriers are a common issue that you could face. Sometimes the case or the contact is a child. That's one issue that you'll have to address. And you'll need to find someone else that you can talk to, like the child's parent, when you're going to talk to them about isolation or quarantine. But that adds another layer of complexity. Sometimes the person that you're trying to reach, the case, for example, might be too sick to take a call or may be very sick on the call and because of that, unable to answer your questions. That could be a common issue. Another common issue could be that the case or even the contact you're trying to reach is deceased. Again, this is not an exhaustive list of the issues you'll find in your daily life as a contact tracer, but just to give you some examples of common ones. So again, we can't go through exactly how to solve each of these problems, but we can give you some advice on best practices for dealing with issues related to cases and contacts. Whenever possible, you should involve the person in the problem-solving process. 
So you need to engage them in thinking about how to solve whatever issue you're facing. As always, you should be an active listener and empathizing with them. And you should always put the full details of your conversation into your call notes. Again, you'll want to know and remember in the future what happened on the call, and someone else may also need to know these details. Whenever possible, you can use secondary sources of data. 
So for example, with permission, you could talk about their medical details with someone else in the family. This would be, for example, if someone is too sick to talk to you themselves. You could also try to find contact information from other available data that you may have. 
So let's say, for example, the phone number you have for the case doesn't seem to be valid. You might be able to go back to some of the medical records that you have or lab reports and see if there's another number that you might be able to try. But always remember that you need to follow your local protocol. And of course, escalate any issues to your supervisor if and when needed. Don't be afraid to do that. Let's talk about one specific issue that you may encounter, and that's communicating with someone who speaks another language. This could create a language barrier if the person does not speak English well. And individuals with language barriers or people who don't speak English well may be less likely to receive care or less likely to access care. They could be at increased risk of medical errors. They could receive reduced quality of care compared to others. And they may be less satisfied with their medical care. They could be more vulnerable than others during the pandemic. If the person you're talking to doesn't speak English well, then you should work with an interpreter. There are translation services like language lines. Or other contact tracers who speak their language may be available to help you. Make sure you agree on ground rules with both the case or the person being interviewed and the interpreter before the interview begins. 
So for example, you'd want to be sure that the interviewer is saying everything that you say and not just paraphrasing because that could hurt your rapport. You always should speak directly to the case whenever possible and ask for clarifications as you go when you're working with an interpreter. 

> *It's important to note that children should not be used as interpreters.*

Often, other family members may offer to translate during these conversations, but because you're talking about private information and you do want open, honest answers, it's best practice to use a translation service in these kinds of situations. Now let's talk about another problem or issue you could encounter, where the case or contact is deceased. 

So in this situation, you won't be able to talk to the case or the contact, clearly. But you should still try to use secondary sources of information to get the information you need. 

So the contact tracing effort will still be vital. Even if the case has died, for example, you still want to know who they had contact with so that you can find them and make sure they know they've been exposed and can quarantine. 

So if it's the case who has died, you could ask to speak to the next of kin or their close relative or associate to ask them that kind of information. For contacts who are deceased, you could try to identify if they had any COVID-related symptoms before they died. And you may want to alert your supervisor and follow your local protocol depending on what you learn. 

> *In these difficult situations, it will be particularly important to empathize with the person you're talking to.*

You should acknowledge their loss. You should understand that contact tracing is less important than the loss that they've suffered and be respectful of that. However, you should still communicate the benefit to society of contact tracing. Because although it's a very difficult time for the person that you're speaking with, getting information from them that will allow you to continue the contact tracing process is important to reduce the risk to other members of their community.

## Video: Addressing Context Complexities
SPEAKER: Finally, let's talk about some complexities that you may encounter with context and how you can address those. We all have to recognize that this pandemic is ongoing, and it's a dynamic situation. So there are going to be difficulties related explicitly to this context, and there are going to be difficulties that are happening because this is a pandemic. One example is that tests may be difficult to get. Another example is that your local protocols for contact tracing may change, and they may change quickly. So this is something to keep in mind. Another common issue related to context could be when cases or contacts tell you that they're unable to quarantine or isolate themselves. And this could be, just for example, when contacts have new people coming into their homes. Maybe they're having roommate problems, or they're not in control of who comes and goes in the place where they live. Another example could be cases or contacts that have children that they need to care for, and there's no one else who can do this job. And again, we're not going to go through all of the possible problems you can have with context, but some best practices are these. So you should try as much as possible to identify and communicate community resources that may be available for cases or contacts to help them navigate some of these issues. For example, in some places, people who cannot isolate themselves or quarantine at home may have the option of moving to alternative housing during that time. This is going to really depend on where you are and what resources are available, but just make sure you know what's available to help people out. Also, your role should always be to brainstorm with the case or the contact potential solutions to their problem. They're going to have information about their particular situation that you'll never have. So it's important to work with them to find solutions, solutions that will work. And again, always follow your local protocol, and don't ever hesitate to contact your supervisor if you need help. So let's go through a specific example of an issue and how you might solve it. So let's say you call the contact, and they're symptomatic, and they're demanding a test. They're scared and they're afraid that they may have COVID-19. So first, you would want to brainstorm solutions with them. You'd want to check and see if testing is recommended based on your local protocol and the risk group that this person may be in. Sometimes whether or not you're able to access a test can depend on signs and symptoms or other underlying medical conditions that you have. So you'll need to know what your local protocol says. You may also suggest that they contact their personal physician because ultimately their care provider may be in a better position to determine whether or not they need a test and whether or not they can get one. You want to be sure and communicate to them what the high risk symptoms are and when they should seek care so that they can feel confident of when they need to access emergency medical care for their own health. Of course, if possible, it's great to be able to point them to a drive-through or other clinic where they can easily go get a test. But again, this may not be available in all communities.

## Video: Summary
SPEAKER: So let's summarize everything that you've learned now about building rapport and effective communication during case investigations and contact tracing. 

> *As a contact tracer, it's not just important what you do, but how you do it.*

The rapport that you're able to build with cases and contacts can create trust and increase the chances that the case or the contact is going to provide you with accurate information and cooperate with isolation and quarantine instructions. If we are unable to get accurate information, and if they are unable to follow isolation and quarantine instructions, contact tracing won't work. So this is a vitally important part of your job. You should be assertive, use simple words, and communicate a single message at a time, always actively listening and helping to connect more effectively with cases and contacts. Be sure to combine question types so that you can gather accurate and thorough data from cases and contacts. And whenever possible, avoid leading questions. Contact tracing is a complex activity which requires attention to detail and problem-solving skills. And importantly, you'll need to be solving those problems with cases and contacts. The most common areas you'll need to troubleshoot in contact tracing are issues that deal with process related to your protocol, people, and then also the context. Best practices for successfully navigating solutions are always to write detailed notes, practice active listening, and escalate problems to your supervisors as soon as you notice them. Always follow your local contact tracing protocols. It's possible that your local protocols may differ slightly from what you've learned here, and that's OK. Remember, the pandemic is ongoing, our knowledge is always changing, and so our protocols should also change to reflect that. So in summary, you now know how to be really effective at your job as a contact tracer. And ultimately, your efforts can help stop transmission in your community.
