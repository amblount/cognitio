## Video: Contact Tracing for COVID-19 Prevention

EMILY GURLEY: Hello, my name is Emily Gurley, and I'm an Infectious Disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Today, I'm going to talk to you about the basics of contact tracing for COVID-19. Once you finish this lecture, you should be able to do a number of things, including describe what contact tracing is and how it can be used to stop transmission of SARS coronavirus 2. You should be able to define what we mean by a case of COVID-19, and also be able to define what a contact means. You should be able to explain the meaning and purpose of isolation and quarantine. You should be able to calculate how long a case should isolate and how long a contact should quarantine based on what we know about the infectious period. You should be able to describe the connection between the infectious period in isolation and quarantine, and importantly, you should also be able to identify high risk settings for transmission that might require extra action beyond regular contact tracing efforts. 
So let's talk now about contact tracing and how it's used for COVID-19 prevention. Every case of COVID-19 that's diagnosed requires action. We have to act, and there are a number of ways that we have to act. First, we need to support the person who is infected. 

>*It's important that we act to ensure that they have access to medical care and any social services they may need.* 

They need to be able to access treatment. Right now, we only have basic supportive treatments available, but one day if we have other treatments or curative treatments, they would need to be identified so they can be offered those curative treatments.

>*We also need to act to be sure that those cases are limiting their contact with other people.*

This is important, because someone who is infected can infect others. And part of our goal as public health practitioners is to prevent the spread of COVID-19. So when we diagnose a case, we need to find them, offer them medical support, and also make sure they're changing their behavior to limit their contact with other people to reduce the risk of transmission. Next, we have to also identify all the people that they may have infected. We have to notify them about their exposure and offer them some social services that they may need. If they develop signs and symptoms, we also need to make sure they have access to medical care and offer them treatment. And importantly, we need to limit their contact with other people. So once we find people who've been exposed, those people could become infectious and then infect other people. So if we can get them to change their behavior, we can limit transmission onward. 

>*So the basic idea behind contact tracing is that if we can limit contact between people who are infected and others, then we can limit opportunities for this virus to be transmitted, and this is vitally important for COVID-19. *

This is one of the best ways that we can limit the spread of this disease. Let's also recall the timeline of infection and infectiousness. So here we can see that someone has been infected. You can see in the orange line their incubation period, and that's the time between when they become infected and when they develop signs and symptoms. Then you can see in the blue line, after they develop signs and symptoms, how long they'll have the disease. And then in yellow, you can see, again, the time period that this person is infectious. And that means the time period when they can infect other people. This timeline shows that people can infect others up to two days before they themselves feel ill, particularly on the day of illness and throughout their illness period.

Now, if we assume that someone was infected or exposed to this person and infected on the day that person became sick, if we assume they have a five day incubation period, they're going to become ill five days later. We can also think about their infectious period, which would begin two days before they became sick and would last throughout their illness period. So the point of contact tracing is to find those contacts and ask them to stay home so that they don't infect anybody else. 
 
>*And as you may recall, that window of opportunity to find them before they themselves become infectious and could infect someone else is pretty quick.*

And so this is important to keep in mind when you are finding contacts and tracing contacts. This whole system of finding cases and contacts has to happen on a very short timeline to be optimally effective. Isolation and quarantine, which we'll define shortly, can have a big impact on reducing transmission, because they serve to limit contact between people who are infectious and others. And as we know, stopping just one transmission chain can prevent many future cases. As you can see here, if each infected person infects two other people, an outbreak can grow very quickly. However, if we can stop just one of those people from being infected at each step, we can really have a big impact on the total size of the outbreak and reduce transmission.

## Video: Defining Case, Contact, Isolation and Quarantine
SPEAKER: So now, let's be very clear and define what we mean by case, contact, isolation, and quarantine. Those are important concepts that you'll have to really understand well throughout the rest of the course. So let's define what a case is, and what a contact is. A case of someone who has COVID-19, someone who could infect others, usually this is defined by a positive laboratory test, a PCR test usually, and we've already discussed that. Sometimes we may refer to cases that are suspect or probable cases, which means they may not have had a test yet, but we think they probably have the disease. So that could be someone that you know was exposed to another infectious patient, so you think they probably have it, but they just haven't had their test yet, but sometimes we refer to them as cases as well. So a contact is someone who had contact with a case while they were infectious. So basically, this is someone who's been exposed to someone who was infectious. And we care about contacts, because they could have been infected. And because of that, they need to take special precautions.
So if you'll recall, a case is infectious during their illness, and the two days before their illness began. So you'll want to identify people who had some kind of contact with them during their infectious period. I mean, we talk about contacts, there are really three different kinds of contacts that you could think about. The first is direct physical contact. So anyone that had physical contact with someone who is infectious is at risk for infection. They are definitely a contact. We also talk about close contacts. And I want to define what a close contact means. So this means someone who may not have had any physical contact at all, but was close to the person who's infectious. They were within 6 feet of this person for at least 15 minutes or more. Now, 15 minutes is just a guideline. In some places, they'll ask about close contacts who were nearby the case for 10 minutes or more, or maybe 30 minutes or more. So there's some flexibility there. You'll need to talk with your jurisdiction, where you're working, to figure out exactly how they're defining those contacts. But this is the basic idea that you're nearby the person who's infectious for at least some period of time, and you're within 6 feet, which if you'll recall, is the distance that respiratory droplets can travel. There's a third type of contact that you may also want to think about, and those are people who have been in the same room for an extended period, maybe an hour or more with the infectious person, but they were more than six feet away. So sometimes these people could also be at risk. They may have had contact with the same surfaces, for example, of someone who is infectious. These are called proximate contacts, and sometimes you'll also be looking for these types of contacts when you're doing contact tracing. Now, let's define what we mean by isolation versus quarantine. Both of these terms mean that someone is going to distance themselves from other people. Someone is going to stop having contact with other people. But they mean slightly different things, so let's be clear about these. Isolation means keeping sick people separate from others, from healthy people, or any other person. This can be done with in home, so you can restrict yourself to your home. If you live with other people, you would also need to keep from having contact with other people even within the home. If you're unable to do that within your home, then you may need to go somewhere else to isolate yourself from other people. In some places, people may go to a hotel, or find another place where they can be separate from others. In hospitals, patients will have to have a separate space and have very limited contact with anyone else except health care workers who are wearing the appropriate masks, gloves, and gowns to keep them safe. How long should someone isolate from other people? Well, it should be for the duration of their infectiousness. And as we've already discussed, that will start two days before the onset of their illness, and it will last through the duration of their illness. Some people are sick longer than others, so their infectious period will be longer than others too. But in general, we would say that someone can stop isolating themselves from others safely if it's been at least 10 days after the onset of their illness, all of their symptoms are improving, and they haven't had any fever within the past three days, and this means that they haven't had fever in the past three days, and they also have not been taking medicines to suppress their fever for the past three days. So it's important to check that. 
So quarantine means restricting the movement and contact of healthy people who've been exposed with other people. So we isolate a case, but we quarantine contacts, because they've been exposed, and they could become infectious. Contacts should be quarantined for 14 days since the last contact they had with the infectious patient, the person who may have infected them. So it's important to know when their contact was to be able to figure out how long they need to quarantine. [MUSIC PLAYING]

## Video: Calculating Isolation and Quarantine Duration

>*As a contact tracer, you'll need to be able to calculate how long a case should isolate and how long a contact should quarantine themselves.*

EMILY GURLEY: It'll be based on your understanding of their infectious period, and it will be an important component of working with cases and contacts to limit the spread of disease. So let's go through some examples, very practical examples, using a calendar to see how this might work. So how long should a case be isolated from others? Well, the short answer is ideally as long as they are infectious. But there is a longer answer. We know that by the time they're diagnosed, they may already be sick, so by the time you're investigating this case, their infectious period has already started, probably at least a few days before. So you'll need to talk to them about isolating themselves for the duration of their infectious period. They'll have to monitor their symptoms each day to help you determine if they're still infectious and if they've recovered. And remember, they'll need to isolate themselves at least 10 days after symptom onset, and you'll have to know that their other symptoms are improving and they haven't had fever for three days. So let's see practically what this will look like. Let's assume that you identify a case, and you call them on May 10th. During the conversation with them, they tell you that they became ill on May 9th. So now you know that they were infectious for two days before they became ill, and they will be infectious for at least 10 days after their onset. So that means May 9th plus 10 days equals May 19th, so you can see here in blue their total infectious period, which started two days before their onset of disease and went all the way through May 19th, which is 10 days after the onset. 
 
![2020-06-08_18-50-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45191356/84556655-b8b4ee00-acd8-11ea-8dc6-2f5010541e0d.png)
 
So we know that the case will be infectious at least through May 19th in this example, but you'll need to have continuing follow up to see when they can stop isolating from others, because you'll need to know when their symptoms resolve without use of medication. So the 19th is the earliest time that they can stop isolating, but just a reminder that you'll need to be following up with them to see if they can really stop isolating on the 19th or not. So on this slide, the days of their infectious period are shown in blue, and we assume that we call the case on May 10th, and you're going to ask them about the contacts they had since May 7th. Those are shown here also in yellow. We assume that after you call them, so from May 10th through May 19th, they're isolating themselves, so they're not going to have any additional contacts. 

![2020-06-08_18-53-44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45191356/84556667-cd918180-acd8-11ea-9b5f-14cdc03248e0.png)

So in your discussion with them on May 10th, you'll need to list out everyone they had contact with since May 7th. Now that you've identified the contacts, you'll need to help them calculate how long they should quarantine. So how long should a contact stay in quarantine or distance themselves from others? The short answer is ideally as long as they could be infectious, which means the 14 days since their last contact with someone who is infectious. So there's a longer answer though. Again, it's 14 days since their last contact, because we know almost everyone who is infected will develop illness within 14 days. However, by the time that you are having a conversation with the contact, their contact with the case may have been days ago, so you'll need to figure out how much time they should quarantine from the time you talk to them. And in other examples, the contact may be ongoing. So for example, if they live with the case, they lived with someone who is infectious. So that will require some additional calculations. 

>*It's important to note also that when you're having a conversation with a contact, if they've developed symptoms, they should probably be considered a case, and so then you would talk to them about isolating rather than quarantine.*

Now, let's think through a specific example. Remember the case we already talked about? Well, let's assume that you're going to call one of their contacts, and you're able to have a conversation with this contact on May 13th. And on the call with this contact, you understand that their last interaction, their last contact with the case was on May 10th. If you'll recall, that's the second day of illness for the case, so they should receive instructions to quarantine for 14 days since their last exposure to their case. If their last exposure was on May 10th, you would add 14 days, and so that would mean that they should quarantine through May 24th. So we already mentioned that if a contact lives with a case, then figuring out their quarantine period could be a bit more difficult, because their quarantine periods going to be longer. So the contact should quarantine themselves immediately and then also for 14 days following recovery of the case, because that would be the last time they had contact with an infectious case. So for some contacts quarantine is going to be longer than 14 days. Let's just see what that would look like on the calendar. Let's assume, same scenario, we call the contact on the 13th of May, and it's the same case, but they live with the case this time. So the person that they live with became ill on the 9th. This is the case we talked about before. Let's also assume that the case will be fully recovered by the 19th. This would be 10 days since their onset of illness. Therefore, if the contact has to quarantine themselves for 14 days after their last infectious contact, then they would need to quarantine through June 2nd, because that would be two weeks after the full recovery of the case that they lived with. So you can see in this example where the contact lives with the case, their quarantine period is going to be almost three weeks long, because they'll have to quarantine themselves while they're still having contact with the case and for two weeks after. 

## Video: Identifying High-Risk Situations
SPEAKER: So as a contact tracer, you're going to investigate cases and identify contacts. Sometimes you'll encounter some more risky situations for transmission and you'll have to handle them in a bit of a different way. So now let's talk about what some of those situations might be and how you can identify them. So as you know, when someone who's infectious has more and closer contacts with more people, that can be a really risky scenario for transmission. So there are a couple of important terms to keep in mind here. One is congregate housing settings. And this is any kind of shared living environment where an individual or a family has private living quarters, but shares common dining, recreational, or other facilities with others. These can be risky places for transmission. Also think about high-risk sub populations. And this is a segment of the population that may have characteristics that increase their risk for infection or increase their risk for severe disease. We already know what some of these groups are. Older adults, for example, are at much higher risk for severe disease. 

>*So when you are investigating cases and investigating contacts, talking to them, it's important to be on the lookout for anyone who is a member of one of these special populations that are at increased risk.*

So if you're talking to a case, for example, and they mention that they are in a very dense contact environment where they live closely with other people or have many shared spaces, then this is something you'll want to take note of because you may need to report it to your supervisor. You may need a different approach for contacting the people that they've had contact with. There are other situations where it may be difficult to contact trace and identify exposures. We'll go through some examples of this, as well. But in some cases, people may not even know who they've had contact with, so you may need an institutional approach to identify who their contacts are. Let's say, for example, they were in a movie theater. You may need to work with the movie theater to see who else was in that theater. The case themselves may not know. Let's think of another population, people who may find it difficult to isolate themselves or quarantine themselves within their living environment. We're going to talk about some examples of that, as well. And then finally, there are groups of people who are at higher risk for severe disease or death. And they may need some additional special considerations. So now let's define these four groups and unpack them a little bit more so you understand what you're looking for and when you might need to report to your supervisor that there may be a high-risk event. So the first scenario are dense contact environments. This is where there are large crowds of people. So if a case has recently been at a conference and had many contacts with others, you're going to want to note that and take some special action. If the case frequently has close contact or interactions with others, including physical contact or being within six feet for prolonged periods of time-- these kinds of contacts can lead to what we call a super-spreading event. And that means an unusually high reproductive number. So on average, you know that someone who is infectious who has COVID-19 could infect two to three other people. But if they have contact with dozens of people while they're infectious, then it's possible that they can infect many, many more than two to three people. And so again, this is a risky situation that you'd need to identify because you may need to take more than just the usual contact tracing steps to address this kind of exposure. Some examples of what those dense contact environments might include conferences, as I mentioned, people who've spent a lot of time on mass transit. So maybe they took a flight or they were on a train together for a long time. Religious services or demonstrations are another place where people often have close contact with many other people. The workplace environment could be another example, bars, gyms. Schools with people sitting together in a classroom for a long period of time is another dense contact environment, sporting events and concerts or other places where people are often in very close contact with each other. So anytime you identify a case who's had one of these exposures during their infectious period, you're going to need to report to your supervisor. There may be more than you need to do than the typical contact tracing. So let's talk about the next group, those where it's complex or hard to contact trace and identify exposures. So these are examples where the close contacts may be unknown to the case. So let's say you were at a concert. You may have had very close contact with someone next to you, but you may not know them. You may not know how to contact them. Another example is where the recall of close contacts may not be reliable. So let's say that you're talking to the case and they just may not remember who they've had contact with for various reasons. Another example is where there may be so many contacts that they had, it's difficult to determine who's really at risk and who the possible contacts are that you need to find. So some examples of where tracing contacts can be difficult are in a homeless shelter, for example. So the case themselves may not recall all of their contacts. They may have had contact with multiple people and they can't remember who they were. The contacts may be spread out through multiple jurisdictions. So let's say, for example, the person was in two different shelters in two different counties during their infectious period. So that would make the contact tracing much more complex. You may also have difficulty locating or testing contacts who were exposed to this person. So that's another added layer of difficulty in this kind of setting. In some places, it may just be very difficult for cases to isolate themselves from others or for contacts to quarantine themselves from other people. They may just be unable to distance themselves from others because of either the design of the house or the facility or maybe because they have developmental disabilities and aren't able to distance themselves from others. They need someone for their everyday care. It also may be that where they live, there aren't enough resources like masks, gloves, or staff so that you can adequately keep people separated from each other. So let's say one person is caring for two people. You don't have enough staff so that those people can be cared for independently. There could also be social pressures where they live, which makes it very difficult for them to keep a distance from others. Sometimes people may also be unwilling to cooperate. And that's another difficulty that you would want to notify your supervisor about. So one example of where it may be difficult to isolate or quarantine could be an intermediate care facility. And these are homes with people who have special needs. So the residents may be unable to cooperate or isolate or quarantine themselves because they may not understand basic concepts of hygiene and social distancing, so they may not be able to carry out the instructions themselves and it may be difficult to remove them from other people who are infected within the home because they all need care and there's nowhere else for them to go. It's also harder to maintain resources for effective prevention in those scenarios because they may not be used to using masks and gowns and they just may not have them on hand. So this would be another example of where you'd need to talk to your supervisor right away. So we've talked about the three examples where risk of transmission may be higher. But remember there's a fourth group as well, were the risk of transmission may be higher, but there's also a higher risk of severe disease or death. These are people who are more likely to get infected because they have many frequent close contexts similar to some of these other scenarios. But they also may have underlying medical conditions that put them at risk for severe disease. And they may get exposed to the virus multiple times because of others who they're having contact with. One example of this kind of scenario is an assisted living facility. So it's a congregate living situation where people may have their own rooms, but they share resources like kitchens or other social spaces, so they're at high risk for infection. Most residents in assisted living are over 60 years of age. So they're at higher risk for severe disease and death, as well. And these facilities may have multiple levels of care, including skilled nursing facilities which care for individuals with illness or injury. So they may have some of the same limitations on isolating themselves or quarantining themselves from others. So this is going to be an especially risky situation where people are at high risk for infection, but also severe disease or death. So again, as a contact tracer, you're going to have to help identify these high-risk situations when you're talking to cases or to contacts. 
It'll be really important for you to collect the necessary information to accurately assess this risk. 
So this will include making sure you know where people live and where they are, the type of interactions they have every day. If they're in one of these settings or have been in settings where they could have had contact with many people, you'll need the contact information for the venue. You'll need the name of that venue, where is it located. You'll need details. You'll need the names of their close contacts as best they can remember, but perhaps even details about contacts that they're not able to remember. You'll need specifics about where they've been, so if they were on a flight or a train. If they went to a movie theater, which movie did they see and what time was it? If they were at a conference, what's the name? If they were in a class, who's the teacher and where's the school? You'll need facility names. And this will all help you with helping to control transmission in this scenario. Your identification of this high-risk situation may also depend on noticing a pattern between multiple calls. So maybe, let's say for example, you talk to a few cases in a day and they all may work in the same facility. Well, then that could be a clue to you that there is transmission going on at that facility. And you'll need to escalate this issue. You'll need to report it to your supervisor immediately because it could be some indication that there is a high risk of transmission at that facility. When you're speaking with someone who may be in this high-risk scenario, you'll need to note for them that there may be additional follow-up required. And again, you should immediately escalate and report any kind of high-risk case or contact to your supervisor. Typically, these high-risk scenarios are going to be handled by specific teams that are trained to work with facilities, to work with organizations, to work with these cases and contacts to come up with a comprehensive plan on how to address risk and how to provide the services required to really stop transmission in these scenarios. 

>*So it's important, again, to immediately contact your supervisor if you identify high-risk cases or contacts.*

## Video: Summary
SPEAKER: OK, so let's summarize what we learned about contact tracing. We can stop transmission of COVID-19 if we can identify cases and their contacts quickly and get them to a limit, stop their contact with other people while they're infectious. Cases should isolate themselves as long as they're infectious, and at least 10 days after they became ill. Contacts must quarantine for 14 days after their last contact with an infectious patient. And some cases may have close contact with many people because of where they've been or where they live. Some people may not be able to isolate or quarantine themselves, and these situations should be immediately reported to your supervisor because they require extra special attention and effort to stop transmission.
