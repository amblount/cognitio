#Module 3
## Video: The Basic Steps

EMILY S. GURLEY: Hello. My name is Emily Gurley, and I'm an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. I want to talk to you now about the steps to investigate cases and trace their contacts. By the end of this lecture, you should be able to identify all of the basic steps to investigate cases and trace their contacts. You should be able to provide examples of the kinds of questions that you might ask of cases and contacts during each step. And you should be able to describe the kinds of social support that cases and contacts may need to carry out isolation and quarantine. After all, asking people to isolate and quarantine is difficult, and they may need some additional support. And finally, we're going to present an example of a simple case investigation and contact tracing call so that you can hear what this sounds like in practice. Next, let's go through the basic steps-- naming them, understanding what they mean, and how they come in the sequence. On this slide, you can see the six steps of case investigation and contact tracing.

Please know that this is a major simplification of what's actually happening, but hopefully it can provide you with a framework to think through the different components of what you'll do while you're investigating cases and tracing contacts. So let's go through these briefly first. First, when you call a case, you'll introduce yourself, and you'll get their basic information. We'll talk more about that in just a minute. Next, you would inquire and find out about their infectious period. So you need to ask them questions to be able to determine that. Once you define their infectious period, you would move on to step 3, which is identifying the contacts they had during their infectious period. Then you would move on to step 4 of that call with the case, where you're providing them with instructions on isolation and helping them to identify challenges to their ability to do that. You would also provide them with any support that you could to allow them to isolate. So then we move on to number 5, which is about the contacts. You'll initiate contact tracing, which means calling or contacting the contacts in some way, informing them about their exposure, asking about symptoms, and giving them instructions about quarantine. Finally, in step 6, you're going to implement regular check-ins. And this refers to the contacts as well as the cases, and you're going to follow up with them throughout their isolation or quarantine period. On this slide, you can see how the steps fit together in a sequence, one after the other. 
 
![2020-06-08_19-27-26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45191356/84813775-4dfbff00-afc5-11ea-908e-b4e25b9f45e8.png)

So steps 1 through 4, again, are about calling the case and having a number of conversations with that case on introducing yourself, inquiring about the infectious period, identifying their contacts, and giving them instructions on how to isolate. After that first call, where you've done all four steps, you move on to step 5 where you call their contacts. And that step-- step 5, where you're calling the contacts-- could be repeated many times. It would be repeated for all the different contacts that they had. And on those calls, you're asking about symptoms and instructing them on quarantine. Finally, step 6 is an ongoing step as well. So you're going to be implementing regular check-ins, being in constant contact with the case and their contacts to follow up on symptoms and how things are going with their isolation and quarantine. So you can refer back to this to see how each of the steps are going to link together. Now that we've defined each of the steps, let's talk about what happens in each step and talk about some of the questions that you might use in each of the steps. 
So on this slide, please note that the words in italics are the questions that you may use during each of these steps, or something similar, just to give you an idea of how these conversations flow. 
 
![2020-06-08_19-28-09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45191356/84813833-653aec80-afc5-11ea-8fbf-5c7a8a1ba7b7.png)

First, you might want to identify your organization. To do this, you may say something like, "Hi. This is Julie from the health department." Next, you want to be able to confirm their identity and their residence. Because you're going to be talking with them about personal information, you want to make sure that you have the right person. So when you say, "Is this Swetha," they confirm that it is them. And you say, "Nice to meet you. I need to discuss some sensitive information with you. Before we keep talking, can you please tell me your birthday and address?" And then if they can confirm that, then you can feel confident going on. Next, in this step, you want to discuss the positive test with them, because that's really the reason why you're calling. So you might say, "I'm calling about your coronavirus test. Have you talked with your provider yet?" It's possible that they've already heard about their test from their health care provider. You also want to describe the importance and the benefits of the call to the case. You want to say something like, "I'm calling to see how you are and to help keep you, your family, and your community safe." You want to provide them some assurances and confirm that the call is confidential. So you might say something like, "What we talk about is between you and me." You want to check in about the length and the safety of the call before you continue. So you may say something like, "This call should take about 20 minutes. Is now a good time to talk? Are you in a safe place to talk?" 

> *While you're on the call, it's important to pause and ask and assess about the need for medical care.* 

If you notice that the person you're talking to has trouble breathing, or is having chest pain that doesn't go away, if they seem confused or is having trouble talking, those could be some indicators that the person is very severely ill. And if that's true, you would need to help get them medical care right away. You wouldn't finish the call. You would just turn from the questions you're asking to helping them get medical care. As you remember, step 2 is also part of the call with the case. In step 2, you want to inquire about their infectious period. 
So there are a few questions you're going to have to ask to determine when their infectious period started. If they had symptoms, you're going to ask questions like, "What date did your symptoms start," or, "Did you feel like you had a fever? How has your fever improved without medication? How are you feeling now?" And if they didn't have any symptoms-- maybe it's someone who's been diagnosed with an infection, but they never had signs and symptoms-- remember, we call this an asymptomatic case-- you may ask them, what date did they get tested? 
So depending on the answers that they provide, you can calculate the period of time that the case may have spread SARS-CoV-2 to others or when they were infectious. You can also find out who was close to the case during that period of time. Please note that there may be differences in how the infectious period is calculated, depending on whether there were symptoms or fever. While you're talking with the case, you'll move on then to step 3. Now that you've identified their infectious period, you'll need to identify who they had contact with during that period. So anyone considered a contact of the case during their infectious period will be quarantined, which includes but isn't limited to people who live with the case, were face-to-face within six feet of the case for 15 minutes or more, or had other types of direct contact with the case, like kissing, or had contact with secretions of the case. 
So someone taking care of them may have cleaned up their used tissues, for example. Some helpful questions you may want to use are, "Do you have any caretakers or housemates? Would you be willing to look at your calendar, or phone, or social media to help jog your memory about what you did this past week? Where have you traveled?" All of those questions will help you to help the case remember the things that they may have been doing during their infectious period. So in step 4, you're still on the call with the case, and you're going to issue isolation instructions for them. There are four components of issuing the isolation instructions. First, you'll explain isolation to them in simple terms. 
So what does isolation mean? What are you asking them to do? Then in number 2, you'll ask questions to check that they understood completely about what isolation means and help them make a plan. Isolating yourself isn't easy, so they'll need a plan. Third, you should identify the challenges that may stop them from following your isolation instructions. And then, finally, offer them resources to improve the chances of following the isolation instructions and being able to carry it out. Let's break these four components of the isolation instructions out a little bit more and think about some things you may do. 
So to explain isolation simply, you could say something like this. "Isolation means that you should try to eliminate your contact with other people, except if you need to see a doctor. If you live with others, you might try to find a different place to stay, or you might use your own bedroom and bathroom. If you need to be around other people, you should wear a mask." Next, you'll need to check their understanding and help them make a plan. To do that, you'll need to ask them some questions. 
So you may ask questions like, "Do you have a safe place to stay? Will you need food soon? If so, how could you get it? Do you take any medications, and will you need a refill soon? And do you have a mask?" So they'll need plans. Next, you'll want to help them identify challenges. Again, this could be done through asking them some more questions, like, "What concerns do you have about your responsibilities and mental health?" Some examples of concerns they may have are taking care of their parents or kids, or they're the only employed person in their home. It's also possible they're in a domestic violence situation and may need help finding a safe place to stay. Finally, based on the challenges that they've identified with you, you would want to be able to offer them some resources. 

> *It's important to keep in mind that the resources available to people are going to be different depending on were you are.* 

Some examples of resources you may have to offer them include the 211 number. This is not available in all parts of the United States, but it is in some. And it's a place where people can access some immediate needs they may have. You could put them in touch with food banks, other local services, organizations, or neighborhood and community support groups that can support people during this time. At the end of the call with the case, you're going to wrap up that call. You're going to make sure that you answer their questions and have a plan for follow-up. So you'll say something like, "Thank you for your time. We've talked a lot today, and I've given you tons to think about. You'll probably have more questions over the next few days. If you think of something, Here's our phone number. But either way, I'll be calling back soon to check on you. Bye." After you're done with the call with the case, you're going to move on to step 5, which is contact tracing. When you call a contact, first you're going to inform them that they were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus, or COVID-19. Next, you're going to check to see if they have any symptoms, such as a fever. You're going to provide them instructions to quarantine. You're going to help them identify challenges and offer resources to overcome those challenges. You're going to answer their questions and then make a plan to follow up. So you should recognize many of these, because it's very similar to some of the things you're going to do on the call with a case. Checking if they have symptoms, identifying challenges to quarantine, offering resources, answering questions, and following up are very similar to what you do with a case. Some frequently asked questions from the contacts include things like, "What happens if I get sick? How do I get tested? Do I need a mask? Can you give me a letter for my job or landlord?" And those are questions that you should anticipate and have some answers for when you are ready to talk to contacts. Finally, we've come to step 6, which is implementing regular check-ins. So at this stage, you've established a relationship with the case and with all their contacts, and you're going to make sure that you keep following up with them to check in on their isolation and quarantine and, of course, their symptoms. 

> *It's important to check in on symptoms, because that can determine when they can end their isolation or quarantine.*

So on these regular check-in calls, you're going to ask cases about their symptoms. If they're getting worse, they may need medical care. If they're getting better, then they may be able to end their isolation soon. You're going to ask them, importantly, if they've had new contacts, because then you would need to find those people as well. You're going to offer continued support for isolation. For follow-up calls with contacts, you want to track and see if they've had any symptoms. If so, they may need to get a test and then may also need medical care. And you'll also continue to offer support for quarantine. As a contact tracer, you're going to be providing important support to members of your community to help stop the spread of COVID-19. 

## Video: Observing Basic Case and Contact Calls

SPEAKER 1: In this section, you're going to have the chance to observe some very basic calls with cases and contacts, so you can see how this all works together. 
And this is a case where nothing goes wrong, where they had very few contacts, and they're very agreeable and able to isolate as you instruct. So let's See how this works. 

SPEAKER 2: Hello, may I please speak with Larry Marie? \
SPEAKER 3: This is Larry. Who is this? \
SPEAKER 2: Hi. My name is Amy Jones from the Hillside Health Department. I'm calling to follow up on the lab test you had done last Monday. Is now a good time for you? \
SPEAKER 3: [COUGHS] Yeah, that. Sure, why not? \
SPEAKER 2: Thanks, Larry. Before we keep talking, I need to confirm your date of birth. I have here that you were born in 1947. Would you be willing to confirm the day and month? \
SPEAKER 3: October 25. \
SPEAKER 2: OK, and our records list here that you're living in Hillside on Gail Drive. Could you please confirm the full address? \
SPEAKER 3: Yeah, that's 510 Gail Drive. \
SPEAKER 2: Perfect. Thanks. All right, well, I'm calling today about your COVID-19 test. Has your physician already called you to talk about the result? \
SPEAKER 3: Yes. I was positive. I have coronavirus. They said you might be calling. SPEAKER 2: Yeah, well, we're getting in touch with everyone who has coronavirus. We just want to check in on you, review what your doctor said, and ask a few follow-up questions. We're just hoping to make sure that you and our community stay safe. \
SPEAKER 3: I understand. \
SPEAKER 2: OK, so this should take about 10 to 15 minutes. And if at any point you need to take a break for that cough, you just let me know. Is that OK? SPEAKER 3: Sounds good. It's enough time before my show. \
SPEAKER 2: Right. Don't want you to miss that. And if there's anything that you don't understand, you have questions about, or you need me to repeat, please just let me know. We want to make sure that everything is clear. Got it? \
SPEAKER 3: OK. \
SPEAKER 2: OK. Oh, and also I should mention that everything we talked to today-- talk about today is going to be between you and me, so we won't share your personal details outside the Health Department. \
SPEAKER 3: Sounds good, thanks. \
SPEAKER 2: OK. Well, to start off with, how are you feeling today? \
SPEAKER 3: Well, everything still hurts, and I get tired whenever I walk to the kitchen from the living room. I mostly live on the couch. [COUGHS] \
SPEAKER 2: I'm sorry to hear that. When did all this start happening? \
SPEAKER 3: I think it was last Monday. Yeah, on Monday. I just didn't feel like myself. I got a bad fever. I just felt achy. \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, uh-huh. So any shortness of breath while you're trying to move around? \
SPEAKER 3: Yeah, but mostly I just don't feel great. Like I cough whenever I try to do anything. [COUGHS] \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, you're really not feeling good. \
SPEAKER 3: Yeah, and I told my cousin that I wasn't feeling well that day, she said, I ought to call my doctor right away. \
SPEAKER 2: OK, so all of this was happening this past Monday, the 20th, and now it's Wednesday. Yeah, OK, so you're really right there in the thick of it right now. Does it seem like your symptoms are getting worse? \
SPEAKER 3: No, pretty much the same, honestly. My fever has gone down a bit, but I had a bout of diarrhea yesterday. I'm just real tired. \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, I can only imagine. Have you been taking your temperature? SPEAKER 3: Yeah, the doc told me to do that. So... \
SPEAKER 2: OK, well, do you know what your highest temperature was, like on your worst day? \
SPEAKER 3: Yeah, it got up to 102.3. \
SPEAKER 2: Yikes. That is hot. And what's your temperature today? \
SPEAKER 3: Today it's just 100 degrees exactly. \
SPEAKER 2: OK, so 100 degrees exactly today, but high but getting lower. And it sounds like you're tired, but are you staying in good spirits? \
SPEAKER 3: I'm trying to. \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, I've heard that it can be really difficult. So if I've got this right, since you started feeling sick on Monday, you've been very tired. You've been sore. You have some fever, headache, cough, and some diarrhea. Is there anything else? \
SPEAKER 3: No, that about sums it up. [COUGHS] \
SPEAKER 2: And how about your stomach today? How's it feeling? \
SPEAKER 3: Better than it was, and I can eat today. \
SPEAKER 2: Oh, I'm really glad to hear that. So there's a few more symptoms that I'd like to review with you today. They're pretty common. Would you be willing to let me know if you've experienced any of these since you've been sick? \
SPEAKER 3: Sure. What do you got? \
SPEAKER 2: OK. Any chills with your fever? \
SPEAKER 3: No. \
SPEAKER 2: OK, no chills. And what about vomiting? \
SPEAKER 3: No. \
SPEAKER 2: OK, and with that cough, has your throat been sore at all? \
SPEAKER 3: It was pretty sore on Monday, but it's better now. When I cough, it kind of hurts. \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, I can imagine. I'm sorry to hear that. Could you tell me a little bit more about that cough? \
SPEAKER 3: [COUGHS] Well, if I do anything, I start to cough. But to be honest, I don't really want to do much. If I'm just lying in bed or on the couch, my cough isn't too bad. \
SPEAKER 2: So when you get off the couch and you go to eat or do whatever you need to do in the house, do you feel short of breath then? 
SPEAKER 3: I feel more tired than short of breath. I can fix my food and talk on the phone. But I sure couldn't run a marathon.\ 
SPEAKER 2: All right. So you're not feeling great, but definitely better than Monday it sounds like. So over the next week or so, if you could just keep track of how you're feeling and let us know if you do start to feel worse or if things just don't Seem to be getting better at all. \
SPEAKER 3: Sounds good. Will do. \
SPEAKER 2: OK, and if you ever do start feeling very short of breath, we recommend that you call your doctor, OK? \
SPEAKER 3: Got it. \
SPEAKER 2: OK. All right, so let's move on to this next section here and talk a little bit about how coronavirus spreads. What we know is that about two days before you start feeling sick, you can pass it on to other people. \
SPEAKER 3: Really? That's terrible. \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah. So since you started to feel sick on Monday, it's possible that if you were around anyone this past weekend, they could possibly also get coronavirus. \
SPEAKER 3: Oh, no! I went to choir practice on Saturday. \
SPEAKER 2: Got it. OK. So-- \
SPEAKER 3: Does that mean that-- oh, no. Geez, I can't believe that. \
SPEAKER 2: Larry, Larry, I hear you worrying over there. \
SPEAKER 3: Yeah, I just don't want anyone else to get this. It's not fun, you know? SPEAKER 2: Yeah. Yeah, I hear you.\
SPEAKER 3: Well, I guess it's lucky it was just me and a few other folks there this past Saturday. \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, you're worried about your friends. And it's good to hear that there was only a couple folks there. So let's take it step by step and talk through everyone that was there. \
SPEAKER 3: Are you going to call them? \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah. Yeah, it's the Health Department's responsibility to get in touch with folks who've been around people with coronavirus. It's good for them to know and to pay attention to how they're feeling. \
SPEAKER 3: Right. \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, and like I mentioned, I mean, I need to make sure that you, your friends, our community stay safe. And right now, there's a possibility that they could have coronavirus and not know. If we can reach them and they're able to stay home, then we can stop it from spreading further. \
SPEAKER 3: Yeah, I guess. \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah. OK. Would you be willing to work with me to list out everyone that was there so we can keep folks safe? And you're free to call them first before we reach out. \
SPEAKER 3: Yeah. Jeez, I mean this-- this is a mess. Really a mess. \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah. \
SPEAKER 3: OK, let's do this. Let's do this. \
SPEAKER 2: Thank you, Larry. This is really important stuff. OK. Let's start with who was singing next to you? What's their name? 
SPEAKER 3: Oh, wow, that'd be Annette. \
SPEAKER 2: OK, Annette. And last name for her? \
SPEAKER 3: Peterson. It's Annette Peterson. \
SPEAKER 2: OK. And do you have a phone number for Annette? \
SPEAKER 3: Yeah, we're good pals. Let me get that for you. Give me a second. \
SPEAKER 2: Thanks. \
SPEAKER 3: That would be 646-123-4567. \
SPEAKER 2: All right, 4567. Got it. All right, and since you're good pals, do you happen to know her birthday? \
SPEAKER 3: February 7th, I'm pretty sure. Not sure about the year. \
SPEAKER 2: That's OK. And who was singing next to Annette? All right, excellent. So now we have the five folks that you were at choir practice with on Saturday. And did you do anything else on Saturday? Did you go out to eat after? \
SPEAKER 3: No, I just came home and I mowed the lawn. \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, last Saturday was really beautiful out. I'm glad you had a chance to be outside. \
SPEAKER 3: [COUGHS] Me too. It was great. \
SPEAKER 2: OK, so what about Sunday? Did you do much on Sunday? \
SPEAKER 3: No, I was at home all day Sunday because I had worked a ton on Thursday, lifting a bunch of boxes. So besides choir practice, I just sat at home on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and I relaxed in the house. \
SPEAKER 2: All right, so just Saturday, Sunday, relaxing in the house. And did anyone come over? \
SPEAKER 3: No, it was just me. \
SPEAKER 2: OK, no neighbors, no friends. \
SPEAKER 3: No. I live pretty far out of town. Nearest neighbor's about a half a mile, so I just watched some old favorites. \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, I hear you. So to summarize, you had choir on Saturday, watched TV on Sunday, and then you started feeling ill on Monday. And did you go to work on Monday? \
SPEAKER 3: No, I'm part time, so I called my doc in the afternoon, like my cousin said. The doctor told me to go to a drive-through testing site and then call in sick to work. \
SPEAKER 2: Oh, OK, well, that was quick. \
SPEAKER 3: Yeah, I'm lucky my boss was so understanding. \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, that's a relief. Did you drive there with anyone else? \
SPEAKER 3: No, it's just me in the truck. [COUGHS] \
SPEAKER 2: All right. So since you got tested, have you driven anywhere else? Like gone to the grocery store or gone to visit family or friends? \
SPEAKER 3: No, I've been sitting tight. I've got a garden and a few chickens, so I'm fed. \
SPEAKER 2: Fantastic. Well, then besides your choir practice, it sounds like you weren't in close contact with anyone else. Thanks so much for sharing that. SPEAKER 3: Yeah, no problem. \
SPEAKER 2: OK, Larry, we're just about wrapped up here. But this next part is really important. So because you tested positive for coronavirus, we're officially requesting that you agree to be isolated until we clear you. So what being isolated means is just that you should remain in a space, like your house, by yourself and not leave it-- except if you need medical care. For example, if you start to feel worse, if you break a leg, anything like that. \
SPEAKER 3: I sure hope not. [COUGHS] \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, me too. You already got a lot on your plate. So yeah, basically this just means no work, no grocery stores, no pharmacies, no visiting friends or family, no friends and family visiting you, and no choir practice. And we'll be following up to make sure that you're doing OK. \
SPEAKER 3: Well, let me ask you, how long do you think I'll have to take off from work? \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, well, it depends. But it's really just a matter of your symptoms improving and your fever going away. And if those two things happen, then there won't be as much virus in your system. And with less virus in the system, then you'll be less likely to pass it on to others. But honestly, I can't be that specific right now because we just have to wait and see how you're feeling. It can be 8 days, 10 days, maybe more. It's just hard to say. \
SPEAKER 3: [COUGHS] OK, well, I guess that makes sense. \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, so is there any of this isolation stuff that we've been talking about that you foresee being a challenge for you? 
SPEAKER 3: I don't think so. Like I said, I'm pretty set here. \
SPEAKER 2: OK, OK, so just a few more follow-up questions, and we're getting close to the end. And I just want to make sure that we're kind of-- we're in agreement, OK? \
SPEAKER 3: All right. Sure. \
SPEAKER 2: OK. So if you need groceries, how will you get those? \
SPEAKER 3: Well, let's see. I bet my cousin will leave them on my doorstep. \
SPEAKER 2: Perfect. Yes. OK, and next, next I just want to remind you about some of the concerning symptoms out there for coronavirus. If you start to feel short of breath, if you start to feel confused, if you get a chest pain that keeps going, or you notice any blueness in your lips or in your face, we request that you would get immediate medical attention. Coronavirus can make people pretty sick, and I don't want you to hesitate. So you can call your doctor or even 9-1-1 if any of that happens, OK? \ 
SPEAKER 3: Yeah. Hope I don't need to though. [COUGHS] \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, I hope so too. But if you were to need to, you'll need to tell your doctor or tell 9-1-1, whoever you call, that you tested positive for coronavirus. And that way, they'll be prepared for you. \
SPEAKER 3: Got it. So I should call ahead. \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah. Yeah, and if you go out anywhere, like if you do need to go to the hospital or the doctor, you're going to need a mask. So do you have one of those lying around? \
SPEAKER 3: No, but I have a bandanna. Will that work? \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, that'll be fine. Just be sure to double it up real good, OK? \
SPEAKER 3: Yeah, for sure. \
SPEAKER 2: OK. And will you be needing any medications? Do you have a doctor appointment in the near future? \
SPEAKER 3: [COUGHS] No, I'm really healthy, besides this coronavirus thing. \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah. Yeah, well, it sounds like you're sticking with it. All right, Larry, those are all the questions that I have for you today. Thanks so much for going through all that with me. I know it was a lot to talk about. \
SPEAKER 3: Yeah, but it's important. I just hope everyone's OK. \
SPEAKER 2: Yeah. I admire how much you're hoping everyone's OK and that you care about your friends. \
SPEAKER 3: I can't help myself. \
SPEAKER 2: It's nice. So well, I got to ask you a bunch of questions. What questions do you have for me? \
SPEAKER 3: Honestly, I asked my doctor all about it. So I think I'm good. \
SPEAKER 2: OK. Well, either me or one of my colleagues are going to be calling you later to check up on that fever. And until then, please, please, please, stay isolated like we talked about. And I hope you feel better real soon. \
SPEAKER 3: Thanks a lot. \
SPEAKER 2: See you, Larry. \
SPEAKER 3: Bye, take care. \

SPEAKER 1: Now you're going to listen to a very basic call with a contact. And again, this is a very simple scenario where the contact doesn't have any symptoms and where they're happy to quarantine themselves and have the resources to do so. \

SPEAKER 4: Hello, is this Annette Peterson? \
SPEAKER 5: Yes. \
SPEAKER 4: Hi, Annette. My name is Drew Evans with the Hillside Health Department. How are you feeling today? \
SPEAKER 5: Good. Thanks. What's this about, please? \
SPEAKER 4: Well, I need to discuss some personal health information with you. So before we go any further, I just want to make I'm talking to the right person. I have listed here that you were born in 1958 and that you're living on Pebble Brook Circle in Hillside. 
SPEAKER 5: Yeah, that's right. \
SPEAKER 4: Could you confirm the day and month of your birthday? \
SPEAKER 5: Sure. It's August 4. \
SPEAKER 4: Great. And your full street address? \
SPEAKER 5: 1994 Pebble Brook. \
SPEAKER 4: All right, thank you. So, Annette, I am calling to let you know that last Saturday you came in close contact with a person who tested positive for COVID-19. \
SPEAKER 5: Oh my god! Are you sure? \
SPEAKER 4: Yes, we have strong reason-- \
SPEAKER 5: No, no, no, Jesus, this can't be happening. \
SPEAKER 4: I'm sorry, Annette. I know that this is surprising. I'm here to help you and to understand what it means, offer you some guidance, explain a little bit about what you can do and how you can protect the people around you. \
SPEAKER 5: OK. Yeah, well, sure. Yeah, I guess that's OK. \
SPEAKER 4: This should take about 10 or 15 minutes. Would that be all right? SPEAKER 5: Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. \
SPEAKER 4: Thanks. If there is anything you don't understand or you need me to repeat, please let me know. I want to make sure everything is clear. And before we hang up today, I'll make sure you have a phone number to call if you have any questions. 
SPEAKER 5: OK. OK. So how do we start? \
SPEAKER 4: So as I mentioned, we have reliable information that you were physically nearby someone with coronavirus for an extended period of time last Saturday. \
SPEAKER 5: I mean, I just went to choir. Choir practice on Saturday. Was there somebody there who was sick? \
SPEAKER 4: Unfortunately, I can't give you any information about the person who tested positive, but they did provide your name. 
SPEAKER 5: Oh God, so does this mean we're all going to get sick? \
SPEAKER 4: There is a possibility that you may get sick. Obviously we hope that this doesn't happen. But why we're calling you today is to see how you're doing, to give you some instructions, and to help you make a plan, OK? \
SPEAKER 5: OK, it's just this is not how I expected to start my morning. \
SPEAKER 4: I can imagine, and I'm sorry to deliver this news so early in the day. SPEAKER 5: That's all right. I mean, we're going to make it work. \
SPEAKER 4: Thanks, Annette. So let's get started. How are you feeling today? \
SPEAKER 5: I mean, I'm tired a bit, but I think it's just stress from work. Otherwise, I'm fine. \
SPEAKER 4: Yeah, work can be tough. I hear you. Let's see. So I know that you said you were generally feeling OK, but I need to ask you about a few specific symptoms. \
SPEAKER 5: All right. \
SPEAKER 4: Since Saturday, have you felt short of breath? \
SPEAKER 5: No. \
SPEAKER 4: Do you have a cough? \
SPEAKER 5: No. \
SPEAKER 4: Any fever? \
SPEAKER 5: I mean, I don't think so. \
SPEAKER 4: OK. Do you have a thermometer at home? \
SPEAKER 5: Yeah, but I haven't taken my temperature. I feel fine. \
SPEAKER 4: That's fine. We may recommend that you take your temperature regularly to see if there are any changes over the next few days, but we can talk about that later. \
SPEAKER 5: OK, OK. \
SPEAKER 4: All right, so no shortness of breath, no cough, no fever. Anything else besides feeling a little tired from work? 
SPEAKER 5: No, I'm really pretty healthy. I cycle. I take the dog out about 100 times a day. \
SPEAKER 4: It sounds like you're very busy with that. \
SPEAKER 5: Yeah. \
SPEAKER 4: OK, so since you were nearby someone with the coronavirus, like we talked about earlier, you might have also become sick. 
SPEAKER 5: Right, but hopefully not. \
SPEAKER 4: Absolutely. We hope you don't get sick. But if you were, it would likely happen sometime in the last 14 days after this past Saturday. About half the people who get sick will start to feel bad in about five days after catching it, but nearly everyone who gets sick from the coronavirus will have some sort of symptom within two weeks. \
SPEAKER 5: OK, so I just have to wait it out. \
SPEAKER 4: That's exactly right. But the tricky part is that people can pass the virus on about two days before they even start to feel sick. \
SPEAKER 5: Oh, jeez! \
SPEAKER 4: Yeah, it's wild, right? So since you were around someone who tested positive and there's a possibility that you're positive too, we strongly recommend that you quarantine yourself. \
SPEAKER 5: So I'm just back to staying at home alone without going anywhere? \
SPEAKER 4: Yeah, that's right. \
SPEAKER 5: Right. \
SPEAKER 4: All right, so basically what quarantine looks like is that you should stay away from others entirely and watch for any symptoms. And when I say symptoms, I just mean headaches that don't go away, a cough, a fever, or just feeling unusually tired for a bit, or anything else. \
SPEAKER 5: So how long do I have to do this for? \
SPEAKER 4: Well, if you were around the person with the coronavirus on Saturday the 10th, that means you should be quarantined for two weeks after that date. So not this Saturday, but the next one. So that would be the 24th. Yeah, I hear you. We're asking that everyone with the coronavirus and people like you who've been around those folks to stay at home. That means no grocery stores, no visiting with friends, and no work. What challenges will this cause for you? \
SPEAKER 5: I mean, I don't have much food in the house, and my boss is not going to be really happy. \
SPEAKER 4: It sounds like your boss might be disappointed. \
SPEAKER 5: Yeah, I mean, I guess I can do a lot from home. It's just it's easier to do it at the office. You're sure that this is all necessary though? \
SPEAKER 4: I hear you. We're making a big ask, but we're hoping that this will help protect your community and cut off spread to even more people. You know, breaking the chain, if that makes sense. \
SPEAKER 5: Yeah, I guess so. I'm going to make it work. It'll just take some effort, you know? \
SPEAKER 4: Definitely. So let's make sure that we're in agreement about your quarantine, OK? What's your living situation like? \
SPEAKER 5: I live with my dog, and I have a renter in the apartment downstairs.\
SPEAKER 4: OK, a renter. Do you share any common spaces with your renter? SPEAKER 5: No, no, she's got her own entrance and stairs. She doesn't need to come in here. \
SPEAKER 4: OK. And I heard you say that you don't have much food at home. Is that right? \
SPEAKER 5: Yeah, I didn't go to the store this week. I wasn't planning for this. \
SPEAKER 4: Right. Is there someone who could help you? Or can you get delivery? \
SPEAKER 5: Well I guess I could call my daughter. That could work. \
SPEAKER 4: OK, so your daughter's nearby. \
SPEAKER 5: Yeah, she's around the corner. \
SPEAKER 4: That's lucky. \
SPEAKER 5: Yeah, I love having her around. \
SPEAKER 4: OK. So your daughter will be bringing you groceries. \
SPEAKER 5: Well, can she come in the house, though? \
SPEAKER 4: Oh, we wouldn't recommend that. It would be best if she could just leave the groceries at your door and for the two of you to stay at least six feet away from one another. So preferably she would stay outside. \
SPEAKER 5: OK, that makes sense. \
SPEAKER 4: Do you have any medication that you need to refill soon? \
SPEAKER 5: Yeah. But I could get the pharmacy to deliver. \
SPEAKER 4: Awesome. Do you have a doctor? \
SPEAKER 5: Yeah, Dr. Jones over at the Ashland Clinic. \
SPEAKER 4: Excellent. So if at any point you start to feel sick, you need to call Dr. Jones's office and let them know that you're not feeling well, and that we called you to say that you had been nearby a person who tested positive for the coronavirus. It is important that you mention this so if you do go in, they can take the necessary precautions and they can determine whether you should be tested for coronavirus too. Does that sound good? \
SPEAKER 5: Yeah, that sounds good. \
SPEAKER 4: OK. Same thing if you need to go to the emergency room. Just make sure you call ahead and mention that we informed you about being in close contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus. Do you know which hospital is closest to you? 
SPEAKER 5: Yeah, Mercy Hospital. It's like 20 minutes' drive. \
SPEAKER 4: OK, perfect. And do you have a private car? \
SPEAKER 5: Yeah, yeah. \
SPEAKER 4: That's awesome. So we'd recommend that you drive yourself if possible and avoid any public transportation or driving with anyone else in the car. Got it? \
SPEAKER 5: Got it. \
SPEAKER 4: And lastly, if you do need to go to the doctor or to the emergency room or somewhere else necessary, we strongly recommend that you wear a face mask. Do you have access to a face mask, handkerchief, scarf, or something else? SPEAKER 5: Yeah, I do. My daughter made one for me. \
SPEAKER 4: Great. So we're nearing the end of our call today. But before I go, what questions do you have? \
SPEAKER 5: Honestly, I mean, nothing right now. Oh, but wait. If my boss needs to check that I'm really quarantined, who should she call? \
SPEAKER 4: We may be able to get you some paperwork, and I have your contact information here. So I'll see if we can arrange that. 
SPEAKER 5: Thanks. That would be a really big help. \
SPEAKER 4: No worries. So to summarize, we'd like you to stay home, monitor your symptoms, and let us know if you're having any troubles [INAUDIBLE] to our agreement. You can call me back on this number, OK? \
SPEAKER 5: OK. Got it. \
SPEAKER 4: And we'll be following up regularly and checking in on you, and we'll chat more soon. \
SPEAKER 5: OK, thank you. \
SPEAKER 4: Great. Thanks, Annette. It's been really nice chatting with you today, and I hope that you stay well. \
SPEAKER 5: Thank you. You too. Bye. \
SPEAKER 4: Take care. \
SPEAKER 5: Thanks. Bye.\

## Video: Summary
SPEAKER: Let's summarize now what we learned about the steps in case investigation and contact tracing. There are six basic steps. As we've discussed, you have to introduce yourself to the case, inquire about their infectious period, identify the contacts they've had during that infectious period, and give them isolation instructions. This will include helping them identify challenges to isolation and getting them the resources they need to isolate from others. Next, you'll move on to initiating the contact tracing, so finding their contacts, telling them that they were exposed to someone with COVID-19, checking in on their symptoms, issuing quarantine instructions, and identifying challenges and providing resources to help them quarantine, just like you did with cases in isolation. Finally, you're going to implement regular check-ins with cases and contacts to inquire about their health, see if they need any medical assistance or any other social services as they complete their isolation and quarantine. Now that you've finished this module, you should understand well all the steps you're going to take to investigate cases and contacts and what some basic scenarios of that look like.
