## Video: SARS-CoV-2 Virus
EMILY GURLEY: Hello, my name is Emily Gurley, and I'm an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Today, I'm going to talk to you about the basics of COVID-19, including the virus that causes this disease, some of the signs and symptoms of the disease, and how it's transmitted between people. 
During this lecture, there are a number of important things we want you to learn. 
We want you to be able to describe the origins of the virus that causes the disease we call COVID-19. 
We want you to be able to identify the clinical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and to be able to talk something about the risk factors for severe disease. 

You should be able to describe how someone is diagnosed with COVID-19 and describe when they're infectious. 
> And importantly, you should also be able to explain how this virus is transmitted from one person to another, and how frequently that happens.

Now let's talk about the virus that causes COVID-19.
So the virus that causes COVID-19 is a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large, diverse group of viruses, and you need powerful microscopes to be able to See them. Coronavirus means crown. And as you can See on this slide, the virus looks like it has a crown around it. That's how coronaviruses got their name. There are many different types of coronaviruses, and they infect a wide range of mammals and birds. And some even cause mild respiratory disease in people every year, so coronaviruses are not new. But the virus that causes COVID-19 is, so let's talk a little bit about where that came from.
 
The virus that causes COVID-19, we call SARS coronavirus two. This virus originated in bats, so that means that bats carry this virus and are infected with this virus all the time. But this virus developed a special trick. It developed the ability to jump between species and infect people. And then it developed another very special trick to be able to be transmitted between people, and that's how it came to cause the pandemic that we're experiencing now. 
So this kind of trick that some coronavirus viruses have also isn't new, so this is the third coronavirus that we know of since 2002 that has developed these same tricks. All of these coronaviruses also originated in bats now infect people and can be spread from person to person. 
The first of these viruses was called severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS coronavirus, the first SARS coronavirus. And that emerged in Guangdong, China in 2002. The next virus to develop this trick was the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus or MERS. That emerged in the Middle East in 2012 and still causes human infections and small outbreaks there. More recently at the end of 2019, SARS coronavirus two emerged in Wuhan, China. And because the virus is similar to the virus that caused the first SARS coronavirus, it was named SARS coronavirus two. Here, you can see in yellow some SARS coronaviruses coming out of a cell. Viruses have to live in other cells, and then they replicate in those cells and go on to infect other cells in the body.
 

Video: Natural History of SARS-CoV-2

SPEAKER: Now, let's talk about the natural history of SARS-coronavirus-2. And by natural history, I mean, what happens to someone when they get a SARS-coronavirus-2 infection. 
So what does happen to someone after they're infected with SARS-coronavirus-2? 
Well, many people get an illness that we call COVID-19. COVID-19 is short for coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019, and for short we say, COVID-19. So not everyone who gets infected with SARS-coronavirus-2 gets sick. So not everyone develop signs and symptoms. However, if they do get sick, we're going to talk about what their signs and symptoms are. We would want to know how long they're sick. We'll talk about that as well. Importantly, we're going to talk about how long they can infect people and spread the virus, and where and how people shed the virus. So these are all the different components of what happens to someone when they're infected with SARS-coronavirus-2. 
Let's talk, next, about signs and symptoms of disease. So you may have heard these words before, but it's important to define them so the difference between signs and symptoms. 
Signs of disease are objective measurements to characterize an illness or disease that can be observed during a physical exam. 
So, for example, temperature is a sign of disease, because it can be measured by taking your temperature. Breathing faster than usual is also a sign, because someone can count the number of times that you're breathing per minute and determine whether it's faster than usual.
 Symptoms are not something that can be objectively measured, but how the patient says they're feeling. 
So, for example, fatigue is a symptom, because it's how someone is feeling. They're feeling very tired. Nausea is a symptom, because it can't be measured. It's how someone is feeling. A loss of taste or smell is also something that someone reports. It's something that they're observing themselves, not something that can be observed during a physical exam. Muscle ache is the same. Fever can be both a sign and a symptom, because it can be measured by someone else and you can also feel when you have a fever. So it's important to keep these general definitions in mind. 
Now, let's talk about the signs and symptoms of COVID-19. And this disease is unusual, because it can cause such a wide variety of signs and symptoms. It makes it difficult to classify. So as we just mentioned, some people have no symptoms at all. This is called being asymptomatic. So this means that someone can be infected with SARS-coronavirus-2, and they will never know. They feel just fine. They're perfectly healthy. Other people will have some disease, but it will be mild. They may not need to seek care at all. It may feel like just a head cold, or a very mild fever, or respiratory illness. Other people will have very serious disease. They'll feel very sick, and it can lead to death in some people who develop severe disease. So, again, it's a wide range of signs and symptoms with this infection. 
Among people who do develop signs and symptoms, there are some common signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Many people will develop a fever. Many people will feel very tired, or have what we call fatigue. People may have chills. That often goes along with the fever. Some people will experience muscle pain. Some will develop a cough. Many people think about COVID-19 as a respiratory disease, and think about coughing, but not all people with COVID-19 will have a cough. Many people who have COVID-19 say that they recently lost their ability to taste or smell. Some will have difficulty breathing and feel like they're short of breath. That's a more serious symptom of COVID-19. Some people with COVID-19 could also have a headache and a sore throat. 
It's important to keep in mind that people who have COVID-19 may have only one of these signs or symptoms. 
They may have just a few of these signs or symptoms. Some people may have all of these signs or symptoms. So there's not one right way to define COVID-19. But you should be aware of all the possible signs and symptoms that people may have. And many signs and symptoms of COVID-19 are what we call non-specific. It means they're common to other infections as well. So fever, cough, myalgia or muscle pain, are common to many different types of infections. So people with these signs and symptoms may have COVID-19, but it's hard to tell without a test. Some signs and symptoms are more specific for COVID-19. I mentioned one previously, and that's the recent loss of the ability to taste or smell. About 1/3 of patients report this loss of taste or smell, and this is something that's a bit more specific for COVID-19, because it's very rare in other types of infections. 
There are some signs and symptoms that mean the disease is becoming more severe or progressing, and these are important to know, because when people have these signs and symptoms, they may need to Seek immediate care. 
The most common signs of progression of the infection are increased or more severe fevers, an increased difficulty breathing. Anyone who is experiencing these signs and symptoms should contact a doctor. Patients should immediately seek emergency care if they develop any of these warning signs or symptoms, including, bluish lips or face. That could mean that they're not getting enough oxygen. If they have an increased rate of breathing, which means they're breathing much faster than normal. If they're feeling shortness of breath, which means they feel like they're not getting enough air in, even though they're breathing quickly. If someone is experiencing chest pain when breathing, this is a serious symptom and they should seek immediate care. If someone is waking up from sleep feeling like they're short of breath, and they're not able to get enough air in, they should seek care right of way. Anyone who develops new confusion, so they're confused about events, or people, or what's happening, or they're difficult to wake up, should also seek immediate emergency care. All of these are signs that the patient is not getting enough oxygen, and that's a very serious condition. And they should seek care right away.
One of the ways that COVID-19 causes severe disease and death, is through congesting in the lungs. So our lungs are how we get oxygen into our body. And if the lungs don't function properly, we can't get enough oxygen. So on the left side Here, you can see healthy lungs and what healthy lung tissue looks like. You can see here that the field is dark. This shows you that the tissue is healthy.
 
On the right side, however, are the lungs of someone who has severe COVID-19. So, you can see the same lung area that's pictured on the left, except you can see that it's white instead of dark. That shows that the tissue is severely damaged by the virus, and this shows that this person is having a very difficult time breathing and getting enough oxygen into their body. This shows you what the virus can do, and how it causes severe disease and death.
Now, let's talk about the incubation period for SARS-coronavirus-2. It's important for you to learn the term incubation period, because you're going to hear it throughout this course. 
So the incubation period is the time from when someone is infected until they develop symptoms. 
So usually this takes a number of days. So the incubation period for SARS-coronavirus ranges from 2 to 14 days. So most people infected with this virus will develop signs and symptoms between 2 to 14 days after they're infected. You can see here on your screen the proportion of people who develop symptoms by each day after they are infected. So 5% of all people infected with this virus will develop signs or symptoms within two days. So it can be very quick. And 1/2 of people infected, will develop signs and symptoms within five days. So just five days after infection, 1/2 of everyone infected will develop signs and symptoms. By 14 days, 95% of all people who are infected will have developed signs or symptoms.
 
OK, now let's define the infectious period. This is an important term that you'll need to know for the rest of the course. 
The infectious period is the time at which someone infected with SARS-CoV-2 can transmit the virus to other people. 
So for people who have COVID-19 disease, their infectious period starts two days before the start of their signs and symptoms. And they could infect other people throughout the end of their illness. So we define the end of their infectious period as being at least 10 days after the onset of their illness. And as long as their symptoms are improving, and they haven't had fever within the past three days, we could assume that they're no longer infectious. So it's a bit tricky to identify exactly when the end of the infectious period is, but these are some of the markers we use to identify when someone may no longer be infectious. As you know, some people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 may never develop any kind of symptoms. They are asymptomatic. But they can still be infectious. They could still infect someone else. For these people, it's more difficult to define their infectious period. It's more difficult to define when they could infect someone else. But, typically, we assume this period to be about 10 to 14 days, and we should assume that it started before they had a test that showed that they had the infection, and to last for at least 10 days after the test. 
So now, let's think about the timeline of infection using these new terms that we've learned, the incubation period and the period of infectiousness. So here, first, we see that someone is infected by someone else. And then, they enter their incubation period. So the person is infected, but they haven't developed signs or symptoms yet. They may not know that they're infected. Remember, this incubation period can range from 2 to 14 days, but on average is about five days. The incubation period here is represented in the orange line. At the end of their incubation period, again, which will be an average of five days, but can be up to 14 days, they will develop signs and symptoms of disease. So for people who have mild illness, that illness is going to last about seven days. For people who have more severe illness, that can last two weeks or more. Now, let's think about when that person is infectious, or when could they possibly transmit the virus to someone else. So you can see here in yellow, that this person who developed signs and symptoms here on day 14 was infectious starting from day 12, and they are going to be most infectious on the first day of onset of symptoms, which will be around day 14. So on the day that they first notice that they are sick, the day they first start feeling badly, is the day that they are most infectious, or probably most likely to infect someone else. They can continue to be infectious throughout their signs and symptoms. This will be at least through seven, days, possibly longer. 
Particularly for people who have severe disease, they're going to be infectious for much longer and through the duration of their illness. 
So it's important to remember here a few key things. People can infect others before they become sick, before they know they're sick, and particularly on the day that they're sick. And they can continue to be infectious and transmit to others through out their illness period, as long as that illness period lasts. So that's going to vary from person to person, but we'll be at a very minimum for seven days. 
 

Video: Risk Factors for Severe Disease
SPEAKER 1: So among people who get COVID-19 , some are at much higher risk for having severe disease. Let's talk about what some of those risks are. Some people are much more likely to have severe disease if they get infected. In particular, older adults who are over the age of 65 are much more likely to have severe COVID-19 disease than others. And those risks increase with age. So the older you are, the more likely you are to have severe disease. People who are obese also have an increased risk of severe disease. I want to point out that some people who are severely ill with COVID-19 are young and perfectly healthy. So I don't want you to get the impression that all people who have severe disease are older or have other chronic medical conditions. Sometimes young, perfectly healthy people can also become severely ill. That's rare. It's a small proportion of infections. And children are very unlikely to be severely ill. But it does happen sometimes. Other existing medical conditions that increase the risk of severe disease in COVID-19 include diabetes, hypertension, any kind of lung disease such as asthma or emphysema or COPD, which is chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. People who have heart disease, liver disease, any kind of kidney disease are also at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease. People who have weakened immune systems are also at increased risk. And some people have weakened immune systems because they're taking certain medications like steroids or others that affect their immune function. If someone has HIV and they're on medication and their HIV infection is controlled, they're not at substantial increased risk for COVID-19 severe disease. Let's talk about death from COVID-19. So how does this disease kill? First, if the lungs aren't able to recover-- if the virus damages the lungs too much and the patient is unable to breathe on their own, then that's one way that someone can die from COVID-19. Another way is through lack of oxygen. So if the lungs aren't functioning properly, then you can't get enough oxygen in your body and that can damage many of your other organ systems. And you need all of those to function in order to survive. So damage to those organs can put you at increased risk for a heart attack or kidney failure, strokes or other blood clotting disorders that can all cause death from COVID-19 . Some people are at higher risk for death than others. It depends generally on your health before you get sick and also access to care. So if someone gets sick with COVID-19 but is unable to seek care early in the illness, then they're at higher risk for death. 
It's important for people who develop severe disease to be able to get the supportive care they need quickly. 
Death from COVID-19 is rare among young and healthy people, but it can happen. Death among older adults who have COVID-19 is much more common and it increases with age. 2% to 5% of people aged 65 to 75 years will likely die from COVID-19 in the United States. That risk increases to 4 to 10% among those aged 75 to 85, and is over 10% in people aged more than 85 years old. This is why it's so important to help keep people in these higher age groups safe from infection. 
It's very important that we do everything we can to try to limit transmission to people who are in these high risk age categories. 
Right now, we don't have any specific treatment to cure COVID-19. Although scientists are working very, very hard and as quickly as possible to find treatments. The best treatment we have now is to support the body's functions until the body's immune system can fight off the infection. Many patients with lung disease and severe lung disease require mechanical ventilation. That's a breathing machine. We also call it a ventilator. And it helps patients breathe while their body is fighting off this infection. People who need it will receive this kind of mechanical ventilation support to keep their lungs working so that their body can continue to get the oxygen it needs while it's working hard to fight the virus. Currently, these are the best treatments we have for people who have severe COVID-19 disease. 
Video: Diagnosing COVD-19
SPEAKER: So how does someone know if they have COVID-19? Now, we're going to talk about some laboratory tests that can be used to diagnose this disease.
There are two kinds of laboratory tests you might hear about for COVID-19. One is a diagnostic test, and that test identifies virus that's in the body. It's called a PCR test, which stands for polymerase chain reaction. That's the chemical reaction that's done in the lab to look for the virus. It's also called a molecular test, and it gives us a sign that the virus is reproducing in your cells. Another kind of test is an antibody test. This test can identify antibodies to the virus usually in your blood. Antibodies are made by your immune system to fight off viruses or bacteria. We can identify antibodies that are specific to this virus in your blood. Some antibodies called IgG antibodies begin to develop when you're sick, but they're identified mostly after you recover. Remember that no tests are perfect. This means that sometimes, despite our best efforts, the results from the test could be wrong. When we're looking for active infection, usually, we do PCR tests on people who have current signs and symptoms of the disease. The PCR test detects the RNA of the virus, which means the genetic material of the virus. So this tells us, essentially, if the virus is in the body and replicating in the body. We usually take a swab from the nose, the throat, or the mouth somewhere in our respiratory tract. Saliva can also be tested for the virus, but it's not commonly used. The reason we take samples from the respiratory tract is because that's where the virus likes to replicate in the body. If someone has a positive PCR test, that shows that there are particles of that virus in the sample that was taken. This means there is an active infection there. Sometimes, there are false results, and that means that someone actually is infected with the virus, but their sample doesn't show that the virus is there. 
So not all people with the infection will have the viral RNA in their sample. This is important to keep in mind that just because someone has a negative PCR test that doesn't necessarily mean that they definitely don't have the infection. 
However, if someone does have a positive PCR test, then we can be very confident that they do have COVID-19. Sometimes, we want to know if someone has had the infection in the past. An IgG antibody test is the most common antibody test used for this purpose. Our bodies usually start to produce IgG antibodies 10 to 14 days after we're infected. So they'll start to develop when we're sick, but we'll be better able to identify them after we've recovered. So these antibody tests can be performed after someone has already recovered from the infection or in people who've never had signs and symptoms but want to know if they have been infected. Remember that some people are infected but never have signs and symptoms. A positive IgG antibody test means that you were infected with the virus in the past, but it doesn't tell us when you were infected. So if you have IgG antibodies in your blood, that could mean that you have some protection from future SARS coronavirus to infections. However, we don't know how long that protection will last, and we don't really know how good that protection is yet. So this is something that we're actively trying to learn more about. So to summarize again, there are two types of tests, a diagnostic test and a test to see if you had a past infection. The diagnostic test takes a sample from your respiratory tract. This figure shows a swab being collected from the back of the throat going in through the nose. That will tell us whether or not there's viral RNA detectable in your respiratory tract, suggesting that you have an active infection. By the time you recover, you'll develop IgG antibodies, and if we take a sample of your blood, we can detect those and we can determine if you were infected in the past. Neither of these tests are perfect, but they're very useful tools for identifying people who have had disease and who are currently infected. [MUSIC PLAYING]
Video: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2
SPEAKER: Now let's talk about how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted between people. There are two main ways that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted between people that you need to remember. So as you know, infected people have the virus in their respiratory tract, in their mouths, noses, and throats. And there are droplets that come out of our nose and mouth when we're talking, laughing, coughing, sneezing, singing even. Sometimes you can see them, but sometimes they're so small that you don't really notice them. But they're there anyway. If someone is infected with SARS-CoV-2, then those droplets that come out can have the virus in them. And then those droplets, if they land on someone else's face, in their mouth, nose, or eyes, can infect someone else. So if you are sitting close with someone, you're talking with them. You sneeze. You get a cough in the face. If you're sitting nearby someone, those droplets can travel far enough to infect you. The second way the virus is transmitted that you need to know about is through contact with surfaces that have viruses on them. So we just talked about how the virus is in respiratory droplets of people who are infected. So if those droplets get on surfaces, or they're on the infected person's hands and that person touches a surface like a table or a doorknob, they can leave the virus on that surface. And then the virus can survive or stay on those surfaces, and it contaminates the hands of other people. Now if you touch a surface that has the virus on it, and then your hands touch your mouth, nose, or eyes, the virus can infect you that way. 
That's why hand washing and cleaning are so important for preventing transmission, because many people can get infected through their hands. 
In hospitals, patients have procedures done that may increase transmission. But that's a specific setting, and we're really focused here in this lecture on transmission out in the communities, so outside of the hospital setting.
So as you already know, people who are infected with this virus will have infectious virus in their respiratory droplets. When you sneeze, cough, talk, or sing, those viruses and those droplets can travel up to six feet, which is a pretty long way. And those viruses could land in eyes, noses, or mouths of other people and infect them that way. Or, as we already mentioned, they could land on surfaces. That's why mask use can be one way to reduce transmission. This is primarily to keep infectious droplets from contaminating the environment. So if someone who is infected is wearing a mask, then there are fewer infectious droplets that will come out from their mouth and nose. Wearing masks is a great way to prevent people from infecting others.
Something to keep in mind is that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted very efficiently. So this virus transmits between people in ways that make it very difficult to detect and stop. People are infectious before they have symptoms, so they may be infecting others and not even know it. Some people never develop symptoms, and so they could also infect other people without knowing that they, themselves, are infected. 
So it's important for us to test symptomatic people and identify who they've had contact with quickly to try to limit the spread. 
This is done through contact tracing, and you'll hear more about this. 
So knowing how the disease is transmitted, it makes sense that transmission is more likely to occur the closer the contact you have with someone else. So people who have physical contact with a patient or have close contact are more likely to be infected. By close contact, we mean people who are within six feet of the patient for 15 minutes or more. Now why six feet? Well, that's the distance that we know that those infectious respiratory droplets can travel. And 15 minutes means that you've been around them long enough so that you may have come into contact with some of those infectious droplets. So that's what we call a close contact. And close contacts may have never had actual physical contact with the patient, but they're close enough so that they could be at risk for transmission. People who share an environment with someone who's infected are at some risk for infection themselves. And an example of a shared environment is an office or even a restaurant, if you're close enough to the person. Sharing food and bathrooms is another example of a shared environment where infection could be transmitted. And sharing a bed is another way that transmission could occur. Again, because you're in close contact or physical contact with someone who has the disease. For all of these reasons, transmission is much more likely between people who live together, because they're often having physical contact as well as sharing spaces.
There are some living conditions that dramatically increase the risk for transmission. Sometimes we call these congregate housing settings, and it means essentially when there are many people living in very close quarters. Prisons and jails are examples of congregate housing, as are group homes, dormitories as like at schools, or shelters. These places are all high risk for very quick spread of the infection, because people are living close together and sharing spaces.
When we think about risk for transmission, nursing homes really represent a worst case scenario for COVID-19. This is because you have, of course, people living in close quarters together who may have frequent contact with each other. But they also represent a group of people who are at very high risk for severe disease because of older age, multiple underlying health conditions that put them at increased risk for severe disease. They may need multiple interventions, such as feeding and toileting, so they're having very close contact with caregivers. Staff are at increased risk because of this, because they're having such close contact with patients. And importantly, nursing homes aren't hospitals, so they're not well equipped to take care of people who develop severe infections from COVID-19. 
So nursing homes are a place were transmission can happen very quickly, and people will be at high risk for infection. And if they are infected, the health consequences are severe. So these really are worst case scenarios for outbreaks of COVID-19.
Video: Why Stopping Transmission is So Important
SPEAKER 1: COVID-19 is a new disease. And so stopping transmission really is the best way we have to mitigate the impact of this pandemic.
Let's review again what happens when someone is infected. They develop signs and symptoms of disease usually about five days after they're infected, but up to 14 days after their infection. And then they themselves are able to infect others two days before they get sick, particularly on the day that they get sick. And they're still able to infect people as long as they have signs and symptoms, which is at least for seven days.
So let's imagine that they have contact with someone else on the day that they're sick, really as they begin to feel ill. That person, let's assume, will have a five day incubation period. So after they're infected, they will develop signs and symptoms five days later. Here you can See that after they develop signs and symptoms, they'll have disease for seven days. We can also See in the yellow highlighted area Here, when they are infectious. So you can See that they are infectious two days before they become ill, which is really only three days after they were infected. So if we want to interrupt transmission, if we want to stop transmission of COVID-19. We have to find people who have been infected. We have to limit the number of people that they have contact with, so that the transmission chain won't keep going. But you can see in this schematic why that's very difficult to do. Because very quickly after their infection, they will themselves become infectious and able to transmit to other people.
 
So that means that, as you can see here, the window of opportunity for us to act and find those people who've been exposed, find the people who are infected but aren't sick yet, and ask them to change their behavior, to limit their contact with other people, to stop the transmission, that window of opportunity is very short. It happens very quickly. So our public health systems have to respond very quickly when we find cases of COVID-19 and try to find everybody who's been exposed to those cases, so that we can take some action and stop transmission. 
Next I want to introduce you to another concept called the reproductive number. You may also hear it referred to as R naught. The reproductive number is the number of people that one infectious person will go on to infect if everyone they have contact with is susceptible to the disease. It's a good way to think about how fast a disease can spread in the population. And the higher the reproductive number, the more people who will be infected over the course of any outbreak. You can see in this figure some important numbers for R naught and how the number of infected people would change over time, depending on what the reproductive number is. So in the blue line, you can see the number of infected people looks like if the reproductive number is 1. If the reproductive number is 1, this means that every infected person infects just 1 other person. So over time, the number of infected people will not change. It will stay constant. Now what happens if the reproductive number is less than 1? That's what's shown in the purple line here. So over time, if each person infects less than 1 person-- so sometimes, an infected person will in fact someone else. But sometimes, infected people won't infect anyone at all. And on average, it's less than 1 person. Over time, the total number of infected people will come down. What happens if the reproductive number is 2? That means each infected person will infect 2 other people. And we can see that if the reproductive number is 2, the number of infected people will increase very quickly over time. Although typically, we think about the difference between 1 and 2 as not being very much, the difference between a reproductive number of 1 and a reproductive number of 2 is huge in terms of the number of people who will ultimately be infected. So everything we can do to try to get the reproductive number closer to 1 will help us control the spread of a disease.
 
So what is the reproductive number for SARS coronavirus 2? Or to say it another way, on average, how many other people will 1 person infected with this virus infect? Let's look at some examples. So here in this figure, you can see that there's an infected person, represented by a purple dot in the middle. And there are gray dots all around. Those represent the close contacts of this infected person.
 
Measles is another virus that you may have heard of before. Measles is one of the most infectious viruses that we know of. The reproductive number for measles is 15. That means that each person with measles can infect up to 15 other close contacts, as you can see in this figure. It's very infectious.
 
In this figure, we're looking at MERS, or Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome. That's another type of coronavirus. MERS is not very infectious. On average, each infected person-- which is shown here in the purple dot-- will infect less than one other person. You can see that in the dot just above that's partially covered in red. So MERS usually doesn't cause very large outbreaks. Because on average, each case will only infect 1 other person or less.
 
Now let's look at the reproductive number of COVID-19. On average, each person with COVID-19 will infect 2 to 3 other people. And you can see that represented here. There are 2 and 1/2 close contact dots that are covered in red, showing that those are the people who are going to be infected. 
 
This reproductive number of 2 to 3 is very similar to the reproductive number for influenza virus. And you can see that here for comparison. People infected with influenza virus, on average, will infect two to three other people, if everyone they have contact with is susceptible. So a reproductive number of 2 may sound small. But even a reproductive number of 2 can create a large outbreak if each infected person infects just two other people, the size of the outbreak doubles quickly, as you can see in the figure on the slide. 
 
If we can prevent just 1 infection, so that each person infects only 1 person instead of 2, we can have a big reduction in the number of cases over time. So you can see on this figure, if the first person infects only 1 person, and that person infects only 1 person, and that person infects only 1 person, you end up with only 4 cases in this outbreak, instead of the 15 that would have otherwise occurred if you hadn't have stopped some transmission. Just because you can't stop all transmission doesn't mean that you can't have a big impact on slowing down the outbreak.
 
Video: Summary of COVID-19
SPEAKER: Let's summarize now the main points that we've learned in this lecture.
SARS-coronavirus-2 is a new virus infecting people and causing COVID-19 disease. The disease is causing a worldwide pandemic. Although some people never develop any signs or symptoms of disease when they're infected, other people are at very high risk for severe disease and death. People are at higher risk for severe disease and death if they are, older adults, or they have some other kind of pre-existing medical condition, such as diabetes or high blood pressure.

There are laboratory tests that can be used to identify if someone has an active infection, or if someone has been infected in the past. 
And, importantly, for this disease, people are infectious before they become ill, as well as during their illness. 
People who never develop signs and symptoms can still infect other people. This infection occurs primarily through contact with the respiratory droplets of someone who is infected. Without any intervention, each person can infect two to three other people, which means that the outbreaks can grow in size very quickly. However, if we're able to intervene to prevent even some transmission, we can dramatically reduce the number of cases. And this is the public health goal for controlling COVID-19.
